Ada Lovelace Institute The Alan Turing Institute Kantar,TRUE,,kantar_nov_2022,Ada Lovelace,Kantar,Nov,2022,25 October 2024 until 24 November 2024,United Kingdom,3513,,"67% experienced AI-related harm; higher concern among minorities; Two-thirds reported experiencing AI-related harm (e.g., false info, fraud). Higher concern among minority ethnic groups on issues like facial recognition.","Demand for regulation is strong and growing. 72% say laws would increase comfort (up from 62%). 88% believe government should have power to stop risky AI products. Over 75% say government/regulators, not just companies, should oversee safety.",18,"Nationally representative survey with deliberate oversampling of minority groups to capture their views.

SARA 2024,TRUE,,sara_jan_2024,SARA,SARA,Jan,2024,Jan – Feb 2024,Australia,1141,"Catastrophic AI risk, global priority, regulation (new agency, pause)","80% of Australians believe that preventing catastrophic risks from advanced AI should be a global priority on par with preventing pandemics or nuclear war. An overwhelming 86% support creating a new government agency dedicated to AI safety regulation (akin to a ""TGA for AI""). Additionally, about 66% would support a 6-month pause on certain high-risk AI developments to allow for improved safeguards. Australians' top AI-related worries include unsafe or ""misaligned"" AI, use of AI in cyberattacks and autonomous weapons, and AI-induced unemployment.","Published as a research op-ed in The Conversation (Mar 2024), these findings signaled a strong public mandate in Australia for proactive AI governance. The survey's striking consensus – e.g. equating AI extinction threats with global pandemics, and broad support for an AI regulator and even a development pause – was noted in policy circles. It contrasted with the government's initial ""light-touch"" plan, bolstering arguments that the public wants more aggressive AI safety measures.",,,
