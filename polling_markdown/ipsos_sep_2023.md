###### **5 Key Takeaways**


There is openness to
using AI for improving
traffic, spotting disease
early and tailoring some
services – but people are

less comfortable with AI

replacing humans for
advice or key decisions


Healthcare jobs are
expected to benefit most
from AI, while customer
service and creative jobs

are felt to be most at risk


Most people think too
little is being done to
regulate AI by
governments and tech
companies


Despite the recent focus
on AI, most people say
they know only a little
about it, and few are
regularly using
generative AI at work or
in their personal lives


Overall, the public are
more likely to think AI is a
risk than an opportunity –

and one in five think AI is

likely to lead to the

extinction of the human

race

**Ipsos UK Knowledge Panel**


The Ipsos UK Knowledge Panel was
established in August 2020 and is the UK’s
largest online random probability panel.

It currently has over 25,000 panellists,
recruited using random probability
address-based sampling (the goldstandard in UK survey research).
This means every household in the UK
has a known chance of being selected to
join the panel.

For digitally excluded households, Ipsos
provides tablets, free data and technical
support to help them complete surveys

online.


As a result, there is no differential mode

bias, and Ipsos can maximise the potential

of online research to deliver a total

understanding of the UK public.

This report is based on the online
responses of 5,098 panellists (UK adults,
aged 16+), and was carried out between
14 and 20 September 2023.
