##### **PUBLIC TRUST IN AI:** **IMPLICATIONS FOR ** **POLICY AND REGULATION**

1

###### **Introduction**

The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
poised to revolutionise many aspects of life in the UK,
bringing both unprecedented opportunities and
challenges. While AI is not new, the advent of
accessible platforms like ChatGPT has brought it to the
forefront of public attention, sparking both excitement

and concern.

The UK faces significant challenges in public service
delivery, and AI offers potential solutions in areas such
as healthcare, education and administration. However,

a balanced, evidence-based approach to
implementation is crucial.

This report provides UK policymakers and regulators
with insights into public attitudes towards AI, drawing
on Ipsos' UK and global opinion tracking. Our findings
reveal a complex mix of openness and concern among
the public, with views varying significantly across AI
applications and demographics.


Realising AI's potential requires sustained investment,
time, and crucially, public trust. This demands
transparent communication about AI development and
use, coupled with robust ethical guidelines and
regulations. This report delves into these critical
considerations, presenting detailed findings on public
attitudes that are essential for public sector leaders to
successfully deploy AI in alignment with public
priorities and values.

We hope you find this report informative and insightful.

###### **Key takeaways**

Despite growing adoption of AI tools by organisations, public understanding and use remain low, particularly among some

demographic groups. Proactive, targeted education and engagement is needed to improve AI literacy and access.

The public sees AI as benefiting some groups more than others, with more currently perceiving AI as a risk than an opportunity

overall. Building trust will require demonstrating clear benefits and addressing concerns in a transparent way.

People are open to AI assisting humans but uncomfortable with it replacing human judgement for high-stakes decisions.

Starting with high-benefit, low-risk applications tied to public priorities will help build public confidence.

The pace of AI regulation is viewed as too slow by most. The UK needs to establish a robust framework drawing on global best

practices, with public trust and safety as central objectives.

Many of the workforce do not feel ready for AI. Government and businesses should emphasise AI as enhancing jobs and target

skills-building in sectors likely to be most reliant on AI.

Ongoing public engagement to understand evolving attitudes is crucial. Policymakers need to commit to proactively shaping

an approach to AI that earns public understanding, trust, and support.

**5**

Awareness of AI is almost universal at 98%, but only around a

quarter of people say they know at least a fair amount about it.

Despite the huge focus on AI in the media and many workplaces,

public knowledge has not shifted meaningfully in the last six

months, highlighting the gap between the ongoing buzz around

AI and limited public understanding.

Those who say they know more include men, younger people,

those in-work, graduates, and Londoners. People from ethnic

minority backgrounds are also more likely to say they know

about AI than their white counterparts.

Notably, the groups who know more about AI tend to have more

trust in the technology, feel more comfortable with different

use cases, and engage more themselves with AI in their work

and personal lives. This suggests a potential divide emerging

between those who are more knowledgeable and confident in

exploring AI, and those with lower awareness who risk being left

behind as the technology advances.

The rapid development of AI models has led to new applications

appearing almost every month. However, despite this progress,

only 11% of the public report frequent gen-AI use in their

personal lives, a figure mirrored by the 12% of workers who

frequently use gen-AI in their jobs.

This suggests that while people may be interacting with AI

without always being aware of it, conscious use of AI,

particularly gen AI, remains low and has not seen a significant

increase between September 2023 and March 2024.

###### **Perceived winners and losers from AI**


The public have mixed views on what AI

will mean for different groups in society.

On balance, they expect businesses,

patients, students, public sector

organisations, younger people, and

consumers to benefit from the

technology.

~~However,~~ ~~others~~ ~~are~~ ~~expected~~ ~~to~~ ~~lose~~ ~~out~~

from AI overall, including both skilled and

unskilled workers and older people.

This is likely to reflect concerns around

AI replacing workers and barriers around

older people knowing how to use AI. At

the same time, it suggests the narrative

around the benefits of AI is not cutting

through for some parts of society.


_Q: On balance, to what extent do you think the following will benefit or lose out from AI?_









Base: All UK adults 16+ (n=5,098). September 2023

###### **The risks and benefits of AI**


For the UK public, AI continues to be seen

as more of a risk than an opportunity when

it comes to national security, wider society,

the economy and public services.

~~People~~ ~~are~~ ~~also~~ ~~unconv~~ ince ~~d~~ AI wil ~~l~~ b ~~e~~ ~~good~~

for them _personally_ . There have been no

significant shifts in this sentiment since

~~September~~ ~~2023~~ .

Overall, this suggests the public expect

some people will gain from AI but remain

cautious about the broader societal and

economic risks. They will judge AI based on

how it is used and its impact.

[According to the Ipsos AI Monitor 2024,](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/ipsos-ai-monitor-2024)

Great Britain is more nervous than excited

about the impact of AI compared to

countries in Southeast Asia and Latin

America. We are more in line with Europe

and the US.

Comfort with AI is highest where

###### **But people are wary about being ** **misled or humans being replaced ** **by AI**






However, there are also many

uses of AI that make people feel

uncomfortable.

They are most uncomfortable

where AI could be used to mislead

by creating ‘fake’ content

~~featuring~~ ~~famous~~ ~~people~~, ~~or~~

filtering or personalising the

content that people see.

This may be because most do not

feel confident that they could

differentiate AI-generated audio
(78%), images (71%), or video
(71%) from the real thing.


People are also uncomfortable
with AI making high-stakes
decisions that significantly
impact people's lives without
human oversight, such as
assessing welfare benefits (22%
comfortable) or marking exams
~~(24%)~~ .

cases were asked in either March 2024 or September 2023.

###### **Levels of comfort with different AI use cases vary ** **across demographic groups**


The use of AI in healthcare and

security settings have some of

the highest levels of comfort

overall. However, this also hides

some of the largest variations

between different groups in

society.

~~For~~ ~~example,~~ ~~when~~ ~~it~~ ~~comes~~ ~~to~~

healthcare, comfort is much

higher among those who know

about AI compared to those who

do not. Similarly, men are more

comfortable than women, and

graduates are more comfortable

than non-graduates with the

potential healthcare uses.

© Ipsos | Public Trust in AI | September 2024 | Public 15


There are big differences

between age groups too. Those

aged 16-24 are much more likely

to be comfortable than over 75s

with the use of AI in media, the

use of chatbots (whether in

customer services, education and

health settings) and in analysing

personal information to tailor

content for individuals.

Conversely, those over 75 are

much more likely to be

comfortable than those aged 16
24 with the use of AI in health and

security settings (e.g. detecting

crime, identifying those likely to

commit fraud, and detecting
security threats).


This adds further complexity to

understanding public views of AI,

emphasising how perceptions are

shaped by broader priorities and

attitudes. These findings also

demonstrate that those in charge

of AI policy will need to take a

nuanced approach to building

public trust, tailoring their

communications and outreach to

the needs and concerns of

different groups. A blanket

approach is unlikely to work given

the wide range of views across

the population.

###### **Building public trust in AI**


To build public trust in AI,

policymakers and regulators need

to adopt a gradual approach to

expanding its use. They should

start with applications that have

well-defined benefits and

minimal perceived risks. These

initial AI deployments should be

clearly linked to outcomes that

matter to people. For example,

using AI to reduce waiting lists,

support preventative care, and to

help more people stay in work

align well with public priorities.

Openly talking about the positive

impacts of early AI projects can

pave the way for public


acceptance in more complex

areas over time.

At the same time, adopting clear

guidelines for the use of AI will

reassure the public and

businesses when engaging with

AI and its outputs.

Th ~~i~~ s gradual approach w ~~i~~ ll

resonate with the public, helping

to build trust, since over half of

the public (53%) believe that

public services shouldn't use new

technologies like AI until they

have been proven reliable in other

sectors. This will also help to

alleviate existing public concerns

over the sharing of personal data


across public service

organisations, which is key to

realising the potential efficiency

gains in public services from AI

adoption.

Policymakers and regulators also

need to keep engaging with the

~~public~~ ~~to~~ ~~understand~~ ~~how~~ ~~views~~

on AI are evolving. For example,

drawing lessons from public

engagement around net zero,

fairness and making sure no-one

is left behind are likely to be key

principles for AI rollouts too.

#### **AI AND WORK**
## **03**

© Ipsos | Public Trust in AI | September 2024 | Public


**17**

###### **Job replacement and support**



Workers' views on AI's impact on
their jobs are still taking shape.
Only 7% think roles like theirs will
be mostly or completely replaced
by AI in the next 3-5 years, though
this is higher in certain sectors

like information and

communication (16%) and
administration (14%).

The industries where the public
expects to see the biggest
reductions in work opportunities

are customer services and

manufacturing, while teaching,
healthcare, and social care are

seen as less vulnerable.

However, 71% of workers expect

AI will be used in job roles likes

theirs in the next 3 to 5 years,

with 34% thinking AI will be used


a fair amount or a lot. Despite

this, only 39% have taken steps to

prepare for AI at work, with just

12% having done training.

[Separate Ipsos research finds](https://ipsoskarianandbox.com/insight/66/state-of-learning-for-uk-office-employees)

49% of UK office workers have

not had the opportunity to learn

about using AI professionally.

While workers may not be

immediately concerned about AI

replacing them in their jobs, there

is a desire to know more about AI

as it becomes more common in

the workplace. The findings also

suggest a significant need for

upskilling and reskilling

initiatives, particularly for small

and medium-sized businesses

who may have limited resources

and expertise.

###### **Developing the skills needed for AI**

For AI to benefit all of society, people need to feel confident using it,

both in their daily lives and at work.

Currently, workers and jobseekers are almost evenly split between

those who feel confident they have the skills to use AI in their jobs and
those who don't (36% versus 40%). This confidence gap is wider among

certain groups, reflecting the overall pattern of differences relating to

AI: men are more confident than women, graduates more than non
graduates, and Londoners more than average.

The demographic gaps are even starker when it comes to AI knowledge.

Among those who say they know at least a fair amount about AI,

confidence in work-relevant AI skills is almost five times higher than
among those with less AI knowledge (63% vs. 13%). This highlights a

major divide between those well-positioned for the AI transition at work

and those at risk of being left behind. Without concerted efforts to

upskill underserved groups, there is a real danger that AI could

exacerbate existing inequalities in the workforce.

Base: All UK adults 16+ who are in work or looking for work (n=2,681). March 2024

###### **Challenges and opportunities for ** **employers**


The skills divide is a particular

concern in the UK because so

many businesses are small and
medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). While AI has the potential
to boost productivity, many SMEs
are likely to face significant
challenges in building their own AI
capabilities and providing staff
training, given limited resources
and expertise. The AI skills gap
among workers, especially those
from less advantaged
backgrounds, could make it even
harder for SMEs to adopt AI
technologies effectively.

Clear guidelines, use cases and
alignment with key international


markets are crucial for SMEs to

use AI responsibly and efficiently.
SMEs will need targeted support,
which could include providing

access to shared AI resources

and expertise; offering tailored
training programs for staff at
various skill levels; and

developing guidance on managing
the workforce implications of AI,
such as addressing potential job
displacement and building a
culture of continuous learning.

Policymakers will need to work
closely with SME- and sectorrepresentatives to understand
their unique needs and
challenges around AI adoption.


© Ipsos | Public Trust in AI | September 2024 | Public 20

###### **Challenges and opportunities for employers**


Employers and policymakers will
also need to make significant
efforts to upskill the broader

workforce for AI. This will involve

building a robust evidence base
on the specific AI skills needed in

different sectors and roles to

tailor training to different jobs
and knowledge levels.
Importantly, upskilling for AI
should be framed not just as a
necessity but an opportunity. In
the near term, this means

emphasising AI's potential to

assist with routine tasks and

boost productivity, rather than
posing a threat to jobs, to help

address worker concerns.

© Ipsos | Public Trust in AI | September 2024 | Public 21


Of course, some job displacement
from AI is inevitable, and support

will be needed for those affected.

The government, businesses and
education providers will need to
work together to enable effective
career transitions, including
moving into newly created AI
related roles.

Engaging workers directly in
shaping the AI transition will also
be important. Establishing AI
ethics principles and guidelines in
the workplace, developed in
consultation with staff, can

further boost trust.


Preparing the workforce for AI
will need to be an ongoing
process. As the technology
evolves, so too will the skills

required to work effectively
alongside it. Employers and
policymakers will need to commit
to continuously assessing and
addressing AI skills gaps.

#### **REGULATING FOR ** **SAFE AI**
## **04**

© Ipsos | Public Trust in AI | September 2024 | Public


**22**

###### **Public trust and safety**

As AI technologies rapidly advance, it is
crucial that the development and use of
these powerful tools is governed by a
strong regulatory framework. This is
essential to ensure that AI is used safely,
ethically, and in ways that benefit society

as a whole.

However, our findings show that public
trust in AI varies depending on who is using
it. While hospitals and GPs are seen as
more trustworthy, there's less confidence
in local councils and the UK government to
use AI responsibly. The police fall

somewhere in between.

This reflects the wider picture of trust we

see across different organisations. It

emphasises that these existing views will

shape public attitudes towards AI’s use in

various settings.

###### **Implications for AI rollout in public services**


These differences in trust have

significant implications for how

AI is rolled out across public

services.

For the NHS, there is a relatively

strong foundation of public

confidence to build on.

Communicating clearly about how

AI is being used to improve

patient care, while emphasising

the ongoing role of human

clinicians, can help maintain this

trust. This aligns with the finding

that the public is more

comfortable with AI in healthcare

when used to support rather than

replace human expertise and

decision-making.


However, for local councils and

the government, lower levels of

trust present a challenge. These

organisations will need to work to

convince the public that AI will be

used safely and ethically. This

could involve establishing clear

frameworks for AI accountability

~~and~~ ~~oversight~~, ~~engaging~~ ~~with~~ ~~the~~

public to understand and address

their concerns, and being

transparent about how AI

systems are being deployed.

Research indicates that

transparency and human

oversight are key to public

comfort with AI use in areas like

policing and benefits

assessments.


The police will also need to

carefully consider how they

communicate about AI use, given

the sensitivities around law

enforcement. Building robust

safeguards against unfair

outcomes and allowing for public

scrutiny of AI policing tools will be

~~key~~ . ~~This~~ ~~responds~~ ~~to~~ ~~public~~

discomfort with AI being used in

ways that could worsen existing

inequalities.


© Ipsos | Public Trust in AI | September 2024 | Public 24

###### **Addressing concerns through regulation**


More broadly, our findings underscore

the urgent need for policymakers and

regulators to take active steps to build

public trust in AI.

A majority of the UK public (59%)

believes that AI regulation is lagging

behind the pace of technological

change. Similar proportions believe that
the UK Government (60%), international

governments (64%), and technology
companies (57%) are not doing enough

to regulate AI development and use.

There are also doubts about global

cooperation on AI safety, with 58%

sceptical that countries can effectively


work together. Despite this, 7 in 10

believe the UK should take a leading

role in addressing these issues,

suggesting a desire for the UK to set a

global example in AI governance.

Public concern about the risks of AI,

coupled with a lack of confidence in

using and understanding it, reveals

significant barriers to public

acceptance. Convincing the public that

the benefits of AI outweigh the

potential drawbacks will require

demonstrable progress in AI regulation

and a clear commitment to addressing

public concerns.

###### **How can research and evidence support the AI transition?**


**Deliberative**

**Research**

Deliberative research,

dialogue and public
engagement **bring the**
**public voice into**

**decision making** .

From Citizens

Assemblies, to Public

Dialogue, deliberation

and public engagement

are critical tools for

finding solutions to

complex knotty

problems that involve

informed trade-offs

and require people
centred change.


**Evaluation**

Policy and programme

evaluation helps

**demonstrate impact**
**and identify**
**opportunities for**

**learning** and should be

a key part of any new

programme delivery.

As the leading provider

of evaluation services

to UK central

government and

agencies, we support

clients with economic,

process and impact

evaluations.

interventions that will

help achieve new policy

aims.
