**Abstract**

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly influences various aspects of society,
there is growing public interest in its potential benefits and risks. In this paper we
present results of public perception of AI from a survey conducted with 10,000
respondents spanning ten countries in four continents around the world. The results
show that currently an equal percentage of respondents who believe AI will change
the world as we know it, also believe AI needs to be heavily regulated. However,
our findings also indicate that despite the general sentiment among the global
public that AI will replace workers, if a company were to use AI to innovate to
improve lives, the public would be more likely to think highly of the company,
purchase from them and even be interested in a job in that company. Our results
further reveal that the global public largely views AI as a tool for problem solving.
These nuanced results underscore the importance of AI directed towards challenges
that the public would like science and technology-based innovations to address. We
draw on a multi-year 3M study of public perception of science to provide further
context on what the public perceives as important problems to be solved.
### **Introduction**

In the last two years with the launch of Generative AI/Large Language Models (LLM), the public’s
familiarity and interest in AI has increased. With the accelerated development and increasing discourse
around AI, discussion of the benefits of AI and the drawbacks of the technology are also active topics in
the media. Understanding the public perception of AI is important because it impacts how the technology
is devised, developed and deployed for widespread access, adoption and acceptance. Societal perception
can also impact policy agenda, research investments and industry practices. As AI becomes more
prevalent in our daily lives, understanding what drives public perception and how it could be improved
becomes crucial – it impacts the development of responsible and ethical frameworks and is critical for
maximizing the benefits of AI while mitigating risks and concerns. In this paper we discuss results of a
global survey and provide recommendations for improving public perception of this technology.

### **Background**

3M has been studying the public perception of science since the first survey was fielded in 2017 in 14
countries around the world (See Appendix A1 for the list and relevant details of surveys commissioned
by 3M). Over the years, the survey questions have included the topics of AI, robotics and automation.

_**3M State of Science Surveys**_
In the 3M State of Science Index (SOSI) launched in 2018, 64% of the global respondents thought there
would be robots in every workplace during their lifetime [1]. In 2019 3M SOSI, healthcare, climate
change and sustainability related challenges were the top picks from a pre-populated list of issues that
science should most help to solve, while only 8% globally wanted science to help with workplace
automation/AI/robotics [2].
In 2020, pre-pandemic 3M SOSI, 77% globally thought they knew some or a lot about AI, and 60%
globally considered AI as an improvement (not a threat) to society, with 51% considering any impact of
integration of AI/machine learning on their job as mostly positive [3]. However, 64% globally wanted the
government to be more involved in ethics around automation/AI /robotics and 33% viewed AI/automation
replacing jobs as a threat to STEM careers. In 2021 3M SOSI, featuring at number eight out of ten prepopulated options, “data analytics and digital health records to track and improve patient health outcomes”
was chosen by 32% in their top four choices when asked about healthcare advancements science should
prioritize beyond coronavirus/COVID-19. The most common answer chosen was “vaccines for future
pandemics” with 52% putting it in their top four choices [4].
In 2022 3M SOSI, 54% agreed that they trust how private companies are using AI and 65% globally
agreed that AI is an exciting technology that impacts their daily lives [5]. However, 47% also agreed that
they worried that advancements in AI within next five years will cause them to lose their jobs. In 2023
3M SOSI, the percentage that agreed AI is an exciting technology was at 75% globally, while 68% of
Americans, and 80% globally, agreed that AI can help build a more sustainable future [6].

_**Surveys focused on public perception of AI**_
The last few years have seen an increase in survey-based studies to specifically understand public
perception of AI. Survey responses generally indicate contradictory emotions, in that the public sees the
technology having a significant impact due to its benefits as well as drawbacks, with typically the more
favorable impressions being in emerging and/or Asian markets and more negative impressions in Western
countries [7].
A 2016 paper examined trends in the perception of AI over 30 years and concluded that the public
had been more optimistic than pessimistic, however, the fear of loss of control of AI, had increased over
the years while hopes for AI increased over time [8]. A 2021 global survey of 10,000 citizens, spanning
eight countries across six continents, reported a mix of positive and negative feelings about AI among
respondents [9].
In another recent survey, 66% of respondents agreed that products and services using AI will
profoundly change their daily lives in the next 3-5 years and 49% of respondents say that products and
services using AI have profoundly changed their daily life in the past 3-5 years [10]. An Ipsos survey
reported 46% of workers in the US, UK, and Australia have used AI tools while at work [11]. Although it
appears unclear how the impact on jobs will evolve and eventually whether AI will replace or create jobs,
job loss continues to be an area of concern. A recent survey showed 49% of respondents are concerned
about the impact of AI on jobs [12]. In the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2023, 75%
of companies surveyed said they expect to adopt AI and 50% of the firms expect jobs to be created as a
result while 25% expect job declines [13].

A recent consensus paper in the journal Science describes extreme risks to humans from advanced
AI systems. These include large-scale social harms and injustice, malicious and criminal uses, and
an irreversible loss of human control over autonomous AI systems that can facilitate warfare, conduct
surveillance, customize mass manipulation and more [14]. With much discussion of these topics in media,
not surprisingly interest in AI safety policies, regulation, and support for more intentional approaches in
order to safeguard human values and existence is growing [15].

_**AI as a tool to help humans solve human problems**_
Public perception of AI is currently at a crossroads and there have been some efforts to understand
what drives these sentiments [16]. A gap between people’s competency and their perceptions and a
lack of accurate understanding of AI, can contribute to the public overestimating the abilities of this
emerging technology and underestimating its limitations [17,18]. However, there is also the acceptance
and awareness of AI’s transformative power and that if managed carefully, the technology could serve
human interests by helping to cure diseases, elevate living standards, and protect the environment [19]. In
a recent 21 country survey, 39% responded positively regarding the value AI can bring particularly to
improve their daily lives [20].
US President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) recently published a report
that emphasizes that AI should not replace but instead be employed to empower human scientists [21].
The report explores how AI can “supercharge” research and play a crucial role in tackling major societal
challenges. Augmenting human creativity, critical thinking and ingenuity with AI to do data intensive
analysis is an effective use of AI as a tool for problem-solving [22]. Especially given that general-purpose
AI can be ‘brittle’ in that it can excel in some domains but prone to failure in others because of lack of
human capability for contextual understanding and abstract reasoning [23].
AI directed towards social good has become one of the goals of AI strategies and regulation [24].
Studies have shown that approval of AI can be dependent on the context of application. There is higher
acceptance in sectors that people consider critical areas - where the use of advanced technologies, like AI,
could ensure greater progress [17]. Experts believe that AI has the potential to make a positive difference
for UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [25]. A recent survey conducted in Taiwan linked AI
to UN SDGs and the SDGs for quality education, industry innovation, and good health had the highest
support rate amongst the public [26].
A survey from Australia showed consistently high levels of agreement for using AI for ‘social good’
i.e. to address social, humanitarian and environmental challenges [27]. When respondents were asked to
rate their support to the use of AI in 5 different areas of possible implementation, chosen randomly from
an overall list of 12 areas, the top 3 highest proportions of ‘strong support’ for AI use were in the areas of
health (44.1%) and medicine (43%) followed by ‘environmental challenges’ (41.6%). The researchers
note that despite the contentious nature of issues such as environment, the support did not vary along
demographic lines of age, status or political preference.
With AI rapidly advancing and poised to shape virtually every aspect of human lives, it is crucial to
consider the public opinion and implications as it relates to widespread acceptance and adoption. Given
that, expert recommendations now often reflect not just technical, but social as well as sociotechnical impact and the importance of dialogue, collaboration and action among various stakeholders, to strategically
guide the AI landscape [15].
The combination of utopian and dystopian narratives that concurrently abound can create expectations and confusion about the technology, its usage and its impact. Continual public participation and
education as well as monitoring and understanding of public perception is key for steering the discourse,
development and deployment of AI towards societal benefits in a responsible, accessible and ethical
manner. Furthermore, incentivizing activities that use ‘AI as a tool’ that can benefit society, should in turn
help to improve public perception and acceptance.

### **Survey Details**

The 2024 3M State of Science Insights survey gauges the public sentiment towards science as well as
the public perception of AI [28]. On the topic of AI, the survey included key questions around the
transformative nature of the technology and its use as a tool for problem-solving. The survey also
uncovers the nuanced understanding of impact on perception if a company were to use AI to innovate to
improve lives through products and services.
From a methodological standpoint, the work is in the genre of public opinion polling: it is an original,
third-party research, conducted by Morning Consult. The survey comprising 30 questions, shown in
Appendix A2, was fielded from December 13, 2023, to January 10, 2024, and surveyed 10 countries
across Asia Pacific, North America, South America, and Europe among 1,000 general population adults
(18+) in each of the following countries: Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, South
Korea, U.K. and the U.S. At the 95% confidence level, the margin of error is +/- 1 percentage points at
the global, 10-country level and +/- 3 percentage points for each individual country. For charting and
reporting purposes, the percentages were rounded off to the nearest whole number.
### **Results**

For the purpose of this paper, we will only focus on a subset of the questions and datasets. See Appendix
A3 and A4 for more 2024 data and AI related data from 3M SOSI 2018-2023, respectively. (Unpublished
data from 2024 survey not shown here is available upon request).

_**Integration of AI at work**_
Globally, 50% of survey respondents are integrating AI “somewhat” or “to a great extent” as shown in
Figure 1A, in response to a question around integration of AI at work. China, Brazil and Mexico lead in
their responses to AI usage while Japan reported the highest percentage of those responding with “not at
all.” US, UK, Canada and Germany are well above global average for those agreeing with “not at all” for
AI usage while France is closer to the global average of 25% for those who responded, “not at all.” South
Korea has the largest percentage responding with “very little” integration of AI in their work.

**Figure 1A: General population responses for “To what extent are you integrating AI into your work**
**environment and process (i.e. using AI to write emails or basic code, generating content using AI,**
**etc.)?”** (Question 23 from the 2024 3M State of Science Insights)

Figure 1B shows the gender demographic data for the question around integration of AI into work.
The overall leaders in AI usage, China, Brazil and Mexico, have fairly comparable male and female
responses across the four categories. US, UK, Germany and France have the largest differences between
genders, with only 4% of female respondents in the US using AI “to a great extent” and 42% “not at all,”
while 20% US male respondents are using it “to a great extent” and only 24% responding “not at all.”
Except China, a higher percentage of female respondents report using AI “not at all” in comparison to

5

male. Japan leads in the percentage of females (51%) responding “not at all” for AI usage and has the
lowest percentage (1%) of female respondents who use it “to a great extent” followed by South Korea
(3%) and US (4%). In contrast to US, Canada notably has similar percentages for the genders in those
who use AI “to a great extent” and those who use it “not at all.”

**Figure 1B: Responses grouped by gender for “To what extent are you integrating AI into your work**
**environment and process (i.e. using AI to write emails or basic code, generating content using AI,**
**etc.)?”** (Question 23 from the 2024 3M State of Science Insights)

Figure 1C shows the responses to the same question depicted by age groups of 18-34, 35-54, and 55+
for each country, except for US, which is arranged into age groups of 18-34, 35-44, 45-64, and 65+. Here
Brazil and Mexico show the younger demographic reporting AI usage “to a great extent” while in China
the older demographic, the age group of 55+, leads in AI usage. US, Canada, UK, and Germany show the
same pattern where the usage of AI “to a great extent” is highest for the youngest demographic and no

6

usage of AI is highest for the oldest demographic. In South Korea and Japan, the younger demographic
stands out for those who use AI “somewhat” or “to a great extent” when compared with the two older age
groups that are comparable to each other.

**Figure 1C: Responses grouped by age for “To what extent are you integrating AI into your work**
**environment and process (i.e. using AI to write emails or basic code, generating content using AI,**
**etc.)?”** (Question 23 from the 2024 3M State of Science Insights)

Figure 1D shows the responses to the same question, this time grouped by employment status. Since
this question pertains to using AI in a work environment, it was only asked to respondents who were
currently employed. Among employed respondents, the same trend seen before for AI usage follows, in
that China, Brazil and Mexico lead in integration of AI at work and Japan reported the highest percentage
(46%) of those responding with a “not at all.”

**Figure 1D: Responses for employed subset for “To what extent are you integrating AI into your**
**work environment and process (i.e. using AI to write emails or basic code, generating content using**
**AI, etc.)?”** (Question 23 from the 2024 3M State of Science Insights)

_**Overall sentiments around AI**_

Figure 2 below shows the responses to a series of questions (Q21 ~~1~~ to Q21 ~~7~~ ) that deal with awareness,
usage, expectations and perception of AI. The percentages reported are the sum of percentages that
responded, “strongly agree” and “somewhat agree” when provided with these options alongside three
other options: “somewhat disagree,” “strongly disagree” and “don’t know/no opinion.”

8

The data shows that Mexico, South Korea, China and Brazil are the most worried about their jobs
being replaced by AI. Japan at 47% is closer to the global average of 48% i.e. almost one in two are
worried about their job being replaced. The rest of the countries are below the global average in being
worried about job loss to AI.
In terms of the impact of AI in changing “the world as we know it,” again China, Brazil, South Korea
and Mexico have the highest agreement, while Canada, Germany, UK and US are not too far behind
ranging from 77-72%. Japan is below 70% in believing that AI will “change the world as we know it”
with France at the lowest – 66% agreement.
Regarding perception of “AI as a tool for problem solving,” China, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico
are well above the global average of 68% with China leading at an 89% agreement with this statement.
France has the lowest agreement level (51%) which still means one out of two agree that AI is a tool to
help solve problems.
In terms of seeing themselves using AI in their daily life China leads the pack with 89% agreement,
followed by a distant second Brazil at 72% and then Japan, Mexico and South Korea. Germany at 58% is
close to the global average of 59% while UK, US and France trail here with lowest agreement for France

at 41%.

As reported in many other surveys there is agreement across the countries that AI needs to be heavily
regulated given the global average at 77%. China and South Korea lead with 90% and 84% respectively
and the lowest agreement at 71% for Germany. This is the highest percentage for low agreement across
this series of questions, the second one being “AI will change the world as we know it” (66% lowest
– France) and third is the perception that “AI is a tool for problem solving” (51% - France). All other
questions have one or multiple countries with 50% or less than 50% agreement.
China leads by far, at 88%, in the agreement regarding an increased presence of AI in their daily lives
followed by Brazil at a distant second with 70% agreement. US, UK, Canada, Germany and France range
from 50-53% and well below the global average at 61%.
Finally in terms of understanding where AI is being used in everyday life, China leads with 79%
agreement followed by South Korea (68%) and Brazil (64%) well above the global average of 55%.
Mexico and Germany are above the global average whereas Canada, US, UK and France are well below
with France only at 41%.

**Figure 2: Percentage of respondents who “strongly agreed” or “somewhat agreed” to the question**
**“thinking about AI, how much do you agree or disagree with each of the following.”** (Question 21
from the 2024 3M State of Science Insights)

Figure 3A shows the general population responses to “AI will change the world as we know it.”
Globally 36% of respondents “strongly agree” to this statement. France and Japan are the farthest
below this average with 23% and 21% strong agreement, respectively. France and Japan also have the

9

highest amount of disagreement with the statement with 20% of respondents who “somewhat disagree”
or “strongly disagree.” On the other hand, the countries with the most respondents that “strongly agree”
with this statement are Brazil (52%), Mexico (45%), and Canada (41%). US (16%) leads, followed by
France (14%) and UK (13%) for the percentage that “Don’t know/No opinion.”

**Figure 3A: General population response for “Thinking about AI, how much do you agree or**
**disagree with each of the following? – AI will change the world as we know it.”** (Question 21 ~~2~~ from
the 2024 3M State of Science Insights)

10

Figure 3B shows the data on responses to the same question but grouped by male and female
demographic. Globally, the percentage of male respondents who strongly agreed was 38% and for female
respondents it was 34%. In 9 out of the 10 countries surveyed, male respondents showed higher or
equal percentages of strong agreement. Germany was the exception where 41% of female respondents
“strongly agree” while only 36% of male respondents “strongly agree,” however when looking at total
agreement (“somewhat agree” and “strongly agree”), the percentage for male respondents is greater than
female respondents in every country. The difference between male and female who “strongly agree” was
the highest in South Korea where 38% of male respondents “strongly agree” but only 25% of female
respondents “strongly agree” that “AI will change the world as we know it.”

**Figure 3B: Responses grouped by gender for “Thinking about AI, how much do you agree or**
**disagree with each of the following? – AI will change the world as we know it.”** (Question 21 ~~2~~ from
the 2024 3M State of Science Insights)

11

In Figure 3C the responses to the same question are grouped by age. On average, 39% of 18-34-yearolds “strongly agree” and the age groups 35-44, 45-64, and 65+ all have 35% of respondents “strongly
agree.” US, UK, France, Brazil and Japan all follow a similar trend where the high and low ages agree the
most and the middle age groups agree less that “AI will change the world as we know it.” Brazil has the
biggest differences in agreement between age groups with 59% of 55+ year olds who “strongly agree”
but 47% of 35-54-year-olds who “strongly agree.” Japan has the biggest differences in overall agreement
between age groups where the total disagreement (“somewhat disagree” and “strongly disagree”) for ages
18-34 is 25%, but it is only 17% for ages 55+.

**Figure 3C: Responses grouped by age for “Thinking about AI, how much do you agree or disagree**
**with each of the following? – AI will change the world as we know it.”** (Question 21 ~~2~~ from the 2024
3M State of Science Insights)

12

Figure 3D shows the responses to the same question grouped by employment status. Globally, 37% of
employed respondents “strongly agree” and 34% of not employed respondents “strongly agree.” In 7 of the
10 countries the percentage for employed and not employed respondents who “strongly agree” are within
3%. However, for Mexico, Japan and Brazil the percentages of employed respondents who “strongly
agree” were much higher than the percentages of not employed respondents who “strongly agree.” The
differences between employed and not employed respondents who “strongly agree” in Mexico, Japan
and Brazil were 13%, 10% and 17% respectively. None of the countries had notably high percentages of
“strongly disagree,” France was the highest with 9% for employed and 8% for not employed.

**Figure 3D: Responses grouped by employment for “Thinking about AI, how much do you agree or**
**disagree with each of the following? – AI will change the world as we know it.”** (Question 21 ~~2~~ from
the 2024 3M State of Science Insights)

13

_**AI is a tool**_

Figure 4A shows the responses to “AI is a tool for problem solving” from the general population. Globally,
24% of respondents “strongly agree.” Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and China are again above this average
at 36%, 32%, 75%, and 38% respectively. China also has by far the smallest percent of respondents that
“somewhat disagree” (5%) or “strongly disagree” (1%). On the other end of the spectrum, France has the
lowest total agreement with only 51% of respondents who “somewhat agree” or “strongly agree” that “AI
is a tool for problem solving.”

**Figure 4A: General population responses for “Thinking about AI, how much do you agree or**
**disagree with each of the following? – AI is a tool for problem solving.”** (Question 21 ~~3~~ from the
2024 3M State of Science Insights)

14

Figure 4B shows the data for the responses to the same question as above but grouped for male and
female demographic. Of all the male respondents 29% “strongly agree” that “AI is a tool for problem
solving” while only 20% of the female respondents feel the same.” For every country surveyed, the
percentage that “strongly agree” is higher for male respondents than female respondents. The US has
the greatest difference between agreement of male and female responses with 28% of male answering
“strongly agree” but only 15% of females with the same response.

**Figure 4B: Responses grouped by gender for “Thinking about AI, how much do you agree or**
**disagree with each of the following? – AI is a tool for problem solving.”** (Question 21 ~~3~~ from the
2024 3M State of Science Insights)

15

In Figure 4C the responses to the same question are grouped by age brackets. Globally the trend is
that the younger age groups “strongly agree” more than the older age groups. 30% of 18-34-year-olds
“strongly agree” that “AI is a tool for problem solving, which only 16% of 65+ “strongly agree.” For this
question there is not much imbalance between age demographics. The biggest difference in age group
responses was in China where 41% of 18-34-year-olds “strongly agree,” while only 18% of the 55+ year
olds felt the same. In every country except Japan, there is also a clear trend that as age increases, the
percentage who “strongly agree” decreases.

**Figure 4C: Responses grouped by age for “Thinking about AI, how much do you agree or disagree**
**with each of the following? – AI is a tool for problem solving.”** (Question 21 ~~3~~ from the 2024 3M
State of Science Insights)

16

Figure 4D addresses the same question again but this time the responses are grouped by employment
status. Globally and in each country individually, a higher percentage of employed respondents(27%)
“strongly agree” that “AI is a tool for problem solving” than respondents that are not employed(20%).
Once again Brazil, Mexico and South Korea stand out in this data set. All three have a larger difference
between the two groups of respondents with Brazil having the biggest difference of 13% between
employed respondents and not employed respondents who answered, “somewhat agree” or “strongly
agree.”

**Figure 4D: Responses grouped by gender for “Thinking about AI, how much do you agree or**
**disagree with each of the following? – AI is a tool for problem solving.”** (Question 21 ~~3~~ from the
2024 3M State of Science Insights)

17

_**Perception of companies that use AI to improve daily lives**_
Figure 5 below shows the responses to a series of questions (Q22 ~~1~~ to Q22 ~~4~~ ) that probe the public
perception of companies that are using AI to innovate to improve daily lives. The percentages reported are
the sum of percentages that responded, “much more likely” and “somewhat more likely” when provided
with these options alongside three other options: “no impact,” “somewhat less likely” and “much less
likely.”
The data below shows that China, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea lead in a positive response to such
companies (Q22 ~~1~~ ) while the rest of the countries are all well below the global average of 45% with US,
Canada, UK, Germany, France and Japan all at 29-33% in thinking highly of a company using AI to
innovate to improve lives.
As for intent to purchase from the company, it mirrors closely the responses for Q22 ~~1~~ in that China,
Brazil, Mexico and South Korea show more intent compared to all the rest of the countries are between
25%-31% with global average at 41% showing intent to purchase from the company.
Regarding interest in the company (Q22 ~~3~~ ) the global average is higher compared to previous
questions while the trends remain the same. China, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea lead the pack while
US, Canada and France are at 38% followed by Japan at 36% and Germany at 31%. While for interest in
pursuing a job in the company (Q22 ~~4~~ ) the global average is 41% more likely with again China, Brazil,
Mexico and South Korea leading the positive intent and the rest of the countries between 25-30% more
likely to pursue a job with a company using AI to innovate to improve daily lives.

**Figure 5: The percentage of respondents who answered “much more likely” or “somewhat more**
**likely” to the question “If a company were to use AI to innovate the products and services you use**
**on a daily basis to improve your life, would you be more or less likely to—.“** (Question 22 from the
2024 3M State of Science Insights)

Figure 6A is the breakdown of the general population response for the most positive sentiment in
Figure 5, which was Q22 3, where almost one in two survey respondents would be “more interested”
in learning about a company if they used AI to innovate to improve daily lives. Figures 6B-6D are the
demographic data grouped by gender, age and employment status respectively.

18

Figure 6A shows that China and Brazil are comparable for those who would be much more likely to
want to learn more about the company. Also, France and Japan have an equal percentage who will be
“somewhat more likely” to be interested in the company. Japan also leads in the percentage, at 56%, that
responded with “no impact” on their interest level in a company using AI to innovate.

**Figure 6A: General population responses for “If a company were to use AI to innovate the products**
**and services you use on a daily basis to improve your life, would you be more or less likely to - Be**
**interested in learning more about the company.”** (Question 22 ~~3~~ from the 2024 3M State of Science
Insights)

19

Figure 6B shows that the male and female responses are fairly close for “much more likely,” globally
17% of male respondents and 14% of female respondents answered “much more likely.” This trend
follows for many countries except US, Canada, UK and South Korea –– with the disparity being the
largest in US where 17% males would be “much more likely” while only 8% for females. In addition, US
also led in the percentage of females, 13%, who said they would be “much less likely” to be interested in
learning more about the company compared to males at 8%.

**Figure 6B: Responses grouped by gender for “If a company were to use AI to innovate the products**
**and services you use on a daily basis to improve your life, would you be more or less likely to - Be**
**interested in learning more about the company.”** (Question 22 ~~3~~ from the 2024 3M State of Science
Insights)

20

Figure 6C shows the data grouped by age. Globally, 19% of 18-34, 17% of 35-44, 14% of 45-64,
and 8% of 65+ year-olds are “much more likely” to “be interested in learning more about the company.”
Again, for US the categories are different compared to the rest of the countries. The data shows that the
two younger demographic groups are “much more likely” to have a greater interest in a company using
AI to innovate, compared to the two older groups.
The trend of more interest from younger age group is generally consistent across all countries except
Brazil and Mexico where the 55+ age group showed the strongest response to “much more likely,” while
in Japan and Korea the “much more likely” and “somewhat more likely” put together had a higher
percentage for the 55+ demographic. Interestingly, for several countries the less likely was also higher for
the younger demographic. Japan, Germany and UK had amongst the largest percentage for “no impact”
and in all three cases the percentage was higher for the older age group.

**Figure 6C: Responses grouped by age for “If a company were to use AI to innovate the products**
**and services you use on a daily basis to improve your life, would you be more or less likely to - Be**
**interested in learning more about the company.”** (Question 22 ~~3~~ from the 2024 3M State of Science
Insights)

21

Figure 6D shows the responses grouped by employment status for interest in company using AI to
innovate to improve everyday lives. Across the board, for all countries, the employed(18% globally)
are “much more likely” to be more interested in the company than the unemployed (11% employed).
US, France, Brazil and Mexico have the highest difference between employed and not employed for
“somewhat less likely” and “much less likely.”

**Figure 6D: Responses grouped by employment for “If a company were to use AI to innovate the**
**products and services you use on a daily basis to improve your life, would you be more or less likely**
**to - Be interested in learning more about the company.”** (Question 22 ~~3~~ from the 2024 3M State of
Science Insights)

Figure 7 depicts data for the two job-related questions in Figure 2 and Figure 5. The countries with a
higher worry about losing jobs to AI also have a higher likelihood for pursuing job in companies that use
AI to innovate for everyday lives.

**Figure 7: Data from two questions: 21** ~~**1**~~ **(Figure 2) “Thinking about AI, how much do you agree or**
**disagree with each of the following? — I am worried about my job being replaced by AI” and 22** ~~**4**~~
**(Figure 5) “If a company were to use AI to innovate the products and services you use on a daily**
**basis to improve your life, would you be more or less likely to – Be interested in pursuing a job with**
**the company.”**

Figure 8 shows the response to Q10 ~~8~~ asked in the same survey and specifically relates to ‘green
jobs,’ defined as jobs that contribute to preserving or restoring the environment. Brazil (61%) and Mexico
(57%) lead China (50%) in terms of strong agreement while Japan is the lowest at 17% who “strongly
agree.” Japan, along with Germany also has the largest percentage (17%) of those who disagree. Germany,
US and Japan also lead for “Don’t know/No opinion” category with 22%, 20% and 18% respectively.

**following statements?- ‘Green jobs’ have a positive impact on society.”** (Question 10 ~~8~~ from the 2024
3M State of Science Insights)
### **Discussion**

Understanding public perception of AI is crucial not just for shaping product offerings and the potential
of the technology, but also public policy. Several recent public opinion polls and surveys conducted by
academics and other stakeholders in the AI ecosystem have shown the current, somewhat broad, and
relatively shallow understanding of AI by the public. This is perhaps due to the ambiguous nature of the
technology itself, the level of common knowledge regarding its usage and the media hype specifically
around Generative AI. But given the potentially long-lasting impacts of AI – understanding public
perception and its chronological evolution is key.

24

The 2024 3M State of Science Insights survey results show the paradoxical nature of the public
perception of AI as an opportunity, and a potential threat that needs to be heavily regulated. While
concerns about job displacement and the need for regulation of AI have been consistent themes over time,
and are understandable, it is perhaps important to approach this technology with a sense of possibility. It
is especially important to demonstrate the ability to solve problems with AI given that the public agrees
“it will change the world as we know it.”
There are national differences across the data set, as well as demographic differences, and both warrant
more research to examine the social and cultural factors that can impact impressions, sentimentality
and expectations of AI [29]. Consistent with other datasets, developing countries such as China, South
Korea, Brazil and Mexico show higher awareness and general positive sentiments compared to developed
countries like US, UK, Canada, France, Germany and Japan. Previous survey data from 2021 has shown
that in developing countries “exciting” was the dominant sentiment surrounding AI [9]. China stands out
with the most positive perception [10].
It is important to note that the 2024 3M State of Science Insights survey is amongst the first survey
showing that a large percentage of the global public currently views AI as a tool for problem solving and
there is a positive response to companies that use AI to innovate to improve daily lives. We suggest that
with the agreement associated with the use of AI as a tool, and the positive perception of ‘green jobs’
and their impact on society, there is an opportunity to shape the societal perception of AI by gearing it
towards the problems that need to be solved and the jobs that can help with that.
When a modality can solve a problem its positive perception is likely to increase. This offers an
opportunity for businesses to focus on the benefits AI can bring to society – by using AI to help solve the
problems that matter the most to the public. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer report, 59% of
people do trust businesses with the introduction of innovations into society [30].
Our own research over the years, polling the public perception of science, shows that demonstration
of problem-solving ability can serve to improve perception. Trust in science from 2020 3M SOSI
pre-pandemic was at 85% and by 2023 rose to 88%, while trust in scientists was 80% pre-pandemic and
went up to 86% by 2023 [3,6]. During the pandemic, science was in the public discourse and scientists
were center stage as the pandemic unfolded. Moreover, science and scientists played a crucial role in the
development of vaccines —- science was having a ‘problem-solving moment’ and our data showed a
more positive public perception.

_**Problems people want science and technology to solve**_
Climate change and environmental sustainability related topics feature heavily amongst the problems to
solve that have been top of mind for the global public. (See Appendix A5 for list of problems and the
public response data from 3M commissioned 2018-2024 surveys). In 2024, in addition to 75% of the
global respondents agreeing that ‘green jobs,’ defined as jobs that contribute to preserving or restoring the
environment, are crucial to addressing climate change — 89% globally agree science and technological
innovation should advance the planet and 81% think climate change is one of the biggest threats to
humankind [28].
Experts agree that AI has the potential to make a positive difference for UN Sustainable Development
Goals [31]. AI modalities can help address climate change and its implications, however, among the
problems that will need to be addressed is energy usage. In a 2024 survey, some respondents cited
environmental concerns about the increased energy use needed to train Gen AI models as the reason for
not embracing Gen AI [32]. Judicious and focused use of AI to help with climate tech, green jobs and
science-based scalable innovations could help to solve challenges such as energy usage, and that in turn
can facilitate a broader use of AI to solve for other climate related issues, thereby creating a virtuous
cycle.
A recent study has shown ‘personal relevance’ as an important motivational factor that shapes
information processing and attitude formation, indicating the extent to which an individual commits to
cognitive involvement in a topic such as AI [33]. Moreover, the 2022 3M SOSI results show that many
who do choose STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields do so with pro-social and

25

communal goals such as “solving world’s biggest challenges” or “making a difference in the world” [34].
This sense of purpose in solving problems and human agency in tackling challenges can be a win-win.
Through augmentation of human creativity and ingenuity with the power of AI, businesses can accelerate
innovation and drive progress in areas such as climate change, healthcare and social inequality. By
focusing on the potential of AI to solve the problems that matter most, we can ensure that AI is used to
benefit society as a whole, while inspiring the next generation of jobs and workers.
Public support can be important for emerging technologies, but the interpretation of public opinion can
admittedly be complex [35]. Since technology can shape public opinion while public opinion can shape
technology, it is important to continually measure and monitor engagement and perceptions to understand
the nuances of evolving public perspective, the sentiments shaping it and determine collective course of
action. Harnessing the positive and mitigating the negative impacts of AI can only be achieved through
robust support of stakeholders and effective polices. Deeper understanding of the public perception of AI
through more research is warranted for alignment of future development, innovation and governance with
societal needs. We recommend additional surveys and research into further understanding the problems
public seeks solutions to and the connections between AI and SDGs.
### **Conclusion**

This study of the public perception of AI sheds light on the global landscape of current sentiments
surrounding AI. The public largely views AI as a tool for problem solving and has a positive perception
of companies that use AI for innovations to improve daily lives. Results from our current survey, and the
research into public perception of science, emphasize the ways in which AI may have a favorable impact
on public opinion by using AI for addressing public concerns such as climate change.
Our results align with calls to develop technology that supports public values and serve to build a
foundation for fostering beneficial AI in accordance with societal expectations. Accounting for public
opinion and emphasizing social context in the discussion around the future of AI is important — it can
help to ensure science and technology can serve society and potential social ills such as ”science without
humanity” can be avoided.
With AI permeating every aspect of our lives, reshaping how we think, what we know, and our
overall perceptions of the world around us, it is clear that the public perception of this technology is
complex, multifaceted and continually evolving. Given that, continual public engagement and monitoring
of public perception is key, along with incorporation of the knowledge gained into shaping the technology
landscape.
