**We’ve seen bias. Deepfakes created for propaganda. Attacks on facial recognition**
**systems that led to fraudulent payouts.**

**We collaborated with Harris Poll to better understand Americans’ perceptions of AI and inform**
**our work. MITRE is convening government, industry, and academia to develop frameworks and**
**technology that can make artificial intelligence solutions more safe, equitable, and effective.**

##### **Key Findings: The American public has a general distrust ** **of artificial intelligence (AI) **

# **48% **
#### **of Americans believe ** **AI is safe and secure**

###### **82% **

believe AI should be regulated
###### **78% **

are very or somewhat concerned about AI

~~being~~ ~~used~~ ~~for~~ ~~malicious~~ ~~intent~~
###### **only 37% **

are comfortable with government agencies using AI

to make decisions that directly affect them
###### **only 35% **

Only 35% are comfortable using

AI for autonomous rideshares


**5**

##### **Three out of four Americans are concerned AI ** **could be used for malicious intent.**

**Most Americans worry about the safety and fairness of artificial intelligence**
**systems. These worries grow when they consider AI’s role with important**
**functions like self-driving cars, government benefits processing, or online**
**health chatbots. Their concerns are understandable. We’ve seen news reports**
**about AI systems that can be tricked or corrupted. Others have been biased or**
**simply ineffective. We learned with software and cybersecurity that you must**
**address these concerns from the beginning, not as an afterthought.**

**We need to address these issues with AI now. MITRE is developing advanced AI**
**solutions in various areas and new AI assurance approaches and tools. We are**
**convening government, academia, and industry to address these implications**
**and ensure the responsible use of AI for society.**

**problem.**

**The cybersecurity field has examples including information sharing organizations and**
**vulnerability disclosures where industry collaborates, rather than competes, on security.**
**AI assurance calls for collaboration as well. Better AI assurance will make it more likely**
**that consumers will be comfortable adopting new solutions that industry develops.**
