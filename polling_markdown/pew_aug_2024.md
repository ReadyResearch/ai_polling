# How we did this

Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how Americans’ views of artificial
intelligence compare with the views of those who have expertise in the field. This report includes
findings from a survey of U.S. adults, a survey of AI experts and a series of in-depth interviews
with experts.

Survey of U.S. adults

To understand the views of the American public, we surveyed 5,410 adults from Aug. 12 to Aug. 18,
2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel
(ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses
who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a
chance of selection. Interviews were conducted either online or by telephone with a live
interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender,
[race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP’s](https://www.pewresearch.org/the-american-trends-panel/)
methodology.

Survey of AI experts

To understand the views of AI experts, we surveyed 1,013 AI experts living in the United States
from Aug. 14 to Oct. 31, 2024. To create the sample, Center researchers compiled a list of authors
and presenters at 21 AI-related conferences held in 2023 or 2024. Surveys were conducted online,
and experts were asked to confirm that they live in the U.S. and that their work or research relates
to AI before proceeding. Because there is no definitive source of population benchmarks for this
group, responses from the expert survey are unweighted. They are only representative of the views
of experts _who responded to the survey_ .

In-depth interviews with AI experts

To further explore expert views, we conducted 30 in-depth interviews with AI experts from Oct. 18
to Nov. 26, 2024. The interviews were designed to give AI experts across a range of different
demographic dimensions, including race, ethnicity and gender, a chance to elaborate on their
views. However, the in-depth interviews are not representative of any demographic group or AI
experts as a whole. Quotes have been lightly edited for grammar and clarity.

Here are the questions used for this report, the toplines and the methodology.

With artificial intelligence [no longer the stuff of science fiction, its](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/04/how-ai-is-quietly-changing-everyday-life-00138341) [benefits and risks are being](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/)
debated by everyone from casual observers [to scholars. A new Pew Research Center report](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/as-artificial-intelligence-rapidly-advances-experts-debate-level-of-threat-to-humanity)
examines the views of two key groups: the American public and experts in the field of AI.

These surveys reveal both deep divides and common ground on AI. AI experts are far more
positive than the public about AI’s potential, including on jobs. Yet both groups want more
personal control of AI and worry about lax government oversight.

Still, opinions among experts vary, with men more optimistic about AI than women.

Here are the key findings from surveys of U.S. adults and AI experts conducted in 2024, and indepth interviews with experts.

www.pewresearch.org

**Experts are far more**
**positive and enthusiastic**
**about AI than the public.**
For example, the AI experts we
surveyed are far more likely

than Americans overall to

believe AI will have a very or
somewhat positive impact on

the United States over the next

20 years (56% vs. 17%).

And while 47% of experts
surveyed say they are more

excited than concerned about

the increased use of AI in daily
life, that share drops to 11%
among the public.

2024 and live in the U.S. Expert views are only representative of those who responded. For

[By contrast, U.S. adults as a whole – whose concerns over AI have grown](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/28/growing-public-concern-about-the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-daily-life/) since 2021 – are more
inclined than experts to say they’re more concerned than excited (51% vs. 15% among experts).

**Larger shares of experts than of U.S.**
**adults see AI as personally beneficial.** Far
more of the experts we surveyed believe these
technologies will benefit (76%) rather than
harm (15%) them personally.

The public is far more likely to think AI will

harm them (43%) than benefit them (24%).

Still, one-third say they’re unsure.

## About three-quarters of AI experts think AI will likely benefit them personally, much higher than share of U.S. adults 

_% who say they think the increased use of artificial_
_intelligence (AI) is more likely to …_

**Public optimism is low**
**regarding AI’s impact on work.**
While 73% of AI experts surveyed
say AI will have a very or somewhat
positive impact on how people do
their jobs over the next 20 years,
that share drops to 23% among U.S.

adults.

Large gaps are also present in views
about AI’s effect on the economy,

medical care, education and art.

**Both groups are skeptical of**

**AI’s role in news and elections.**

Only about one-in-ten U.S. adults
and experts think AI will have a
positive impact on elections. Small
shares in each group say the same

for news.

**Similar shares of the public**
**and experts want more control**
**and regulation of AI.** More than

half of U.S. adults (55%) and a

similar share of AI experts (57%)
say they want more control over

how it is used in their lives. And

those in both groups worry more
that government regulation of AI
will be too lax than overly excessive.

1 There were not enough Black or Hispanic experts in the sample to be broken out into a separate analysis. Due to this, we are not able to
report on racial and ethnic differences among AI experts in the survey. As always, these groups’ responses are incorporated into the general
figures for experts’ views throughout this report. We have conducted in-depth interviews in order to further hear viewpoints from a variety of
perspectives. Please refer to Appendix A for the demographic profile of expert responses received.

**Some jobs – like cashiers –**
**are widely viewed as at**
**risk.** About three-quarters of
U.S. adults and AI experts alike
say that over the next 20 years,
AI will lead to fewer jobs of this

kind in the U.S. About half or

more also say this for
journalists, software engineers
and factory workers.

On the other hand, while **62%**

**of experts expect fewer**
**jobs for truck drivers, this**
**drops to 33% among the**
**public.**

And the public is more likely
than the experts we surveyed to
expect AI-related job loss for
occupations like musicians,

teachers and medical doctors.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults

and experts alike say there will
be job loss in each of these
areas, though.

Public uncertainty is a factor.

The shares of U.S. adults who

say they’re unsure range from
13% to 26%, depending on the
job.

We also asked about some specific concerns people might have about AI. Continuing the theme on
jobs, we find the public more anxious than experts about job loss (56% vs. 25% are extremely or
very concerned). We also find:

- **Inaccurate information, impersonation and data misuse are common worries for**
**both experts and the public.** For example, 66% of adults overall and 70% of experts are
highly concerned about people getting inaccurate information from AI.

- **The public is more worried about loss of human connection.** While 57% of the public
is highly concerned about AI leading to less connection between people, this drops to 37%
among the experts we surveyed.

Bias in decisions made by AI is also a concern for experts and the public (55% each say they’re
highly concerned).

[Race, ethnicity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/federal-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-systems-casts-doubt-their-expanding-use/) [and gender often dominate discussions on AI, bias and discrimination – from](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45809919)

these initiatives.

We first asked the public [how they view the representation of various groups in AI design in 2021.](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/03/17/how-americans-think-about-artificial-intelligence/ps_2022-03-17_ai-he_01-05-png/)
In this survey, we explored how public and expert views compare on these same questions.

www.pewresearch.org

14

PEW RESEARCH CENTER


**Both experts and the public see men’s**
**views as better represented in AI design**
**than the views of women.** For example, 75%
of experts say the people who design AI take
men’s perspectives into account at least
somewhat well – but 44% say this about

women’s views.

The public also sees men’s views as better
represented than women’s, even as about four
in-ten are unsure.

**White adults’ views are seen as well-**

**represented in AI design relative to other**
**racial and ethnic groups.** About threequarters of experts say the perspectives of
White adults are well-accounted for. Half say
this about Asian adults’ perspectives, and even
smaller shares say this about views of Black or
Hispanic adults.

Among the public, four-in-ten say the
perspectives of White adults are wellrepresented. A quarter or fewer think this about
the perspectives of Asian, Black or Hispanic

adults.

**The public is far more unsure than the**
**experts we surveyed on this topic,** with

about four-in-ten or more U.S. adults

expressing uncertainty. Still, some experts
surveyed are also unsure.

## Views of men, White adults are seen as relatively well-represented in AI design; views of other groups seen as less so

Quotes from AI experts: Bias and representation

_“I think women, Black women, women of color [are] definitely very underrepresented. People with_

_disabilities are underrepresented … it’s mainly straight White men or men of color who are really investing_

_and excited about these technologies, but … [when] people start to get replaced by technology, it’s always_

_going to affect those underrepresented groups first.” – Black expert_

_“We do not have any African Americans in the department at all … we need to bring these people in so they_

_have a seat at the table. … If it’s the same person over and over again … that is very narrow-minded ... I_

_wish that there were more representation, and they would put more focus on that. But … I do see basically_

_the same kind of people over and over again.” – Hispanic expert_

Questions of who should regulate AI – and how much – are [on the minds of lawmakers amid an](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/06/artificial-intelligence-regulation-in-2025-musk-and-trump-eu-ai-act.html)
evolving political climate.

When we asked experts and the public about this topic, we found common ground in their views. [2]

**Experts and the public aren’t confident that the government will regulate AI**
**effectively:** 62% of U.S. adults and 53% of the experts we surveyed say they have not too much or

no confidence.

**They are also largely skeptical of industry efforts around responsible AI:** 59% of the
public and 55% of surveyed experts have not too much or no confidence in U.S. companies to
develop and use AI responsibly.

_By job sector, among AI experts_


**And experts at colleges and**

# 1. Artificial intelligence in daily life: Views and experiences

Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming more and more part of [everyday life. This chapter](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/02/15/public-awareness-of-artificial-intelligence-in-everyday-activities/)
explores how the public and experts compare in their experiences and views around the use of AI

(such as chatbots) and their control over AI’s role in their lives.


Americans encounter AI in

[various ways, from social](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/16/how-ai-transforms-social-media/)

[media](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/16/how-ai-transforms-social-media/) to [health care](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/ai-transforming-global-health/) to

[financial services. But AI](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/digital-finance/artificial-intelligence-in-finance.html)

experts believe the public
engages with AI more than
they report.

**AI experts** were asked how
often they think people in the

United States interact with AI.

A vast majority (79%) say
people in the U.S. interact with
AI almost constantly or several
times a day.

A much smaller share of **U.S.**

**adults** (27%) think they

interact with AI at this rate.

Three-in-ten say they do so
about once a day or several
times a week, and 43% report
doing so less often.

## AI experts think people interact with AI far more than they say they do

# 2. Views of risks, opportunities and regulation of AI

As the role of artificial intelligence in daily life grows, its challenges and opportunities are front
and center for experts and the public alike.

This chapter covers where experts and the American public differ in their excitement and worries,
as well as where they think AI might surpass humans. It also walks through the areas of
agreement, such as on government regulation, corporate responsibility, and concerns about AI

bias and misinformation.


**AI experts are far more**

**enthusiastic than the**

**American public about the**

**increased use of AI in**

**daily life.** The public, on the
other hand, expresses far more
concern. Roughly half of the
experts surveyed say they are

_more excited than concerned_

(47%) about the increased use

of AI in daily life. By contrast,
only 11% of U.S. adults say

this.

About half of U.S. adults (51%)

say they are _more_ _concerned_
_than excited._ This drops
dramatically to 15% among the
experts surveyed.

## Public is far more concerned about the increased use of AI than AI experts

_% who say the increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life makes_

PEW RESEARCH CENTER


What’s more, the U.S. public has become more concerned over recent years. The share who say
they are more concerned than excited increased from about four-in-ten in 2021 and 2022 to
roughly half in 2023.

Today, identical shares of both groups say that they are equally concerned and excited (38% each).

www.pewresearch.org

25

PEW RESEARCH CENTER

_By gender, among AI experts surveyed and U.S. adults_

Among both the public and AI experts, **men are more excited than women** about the
increased use of AI in daily life. The gender difference on excitement is wider among AI experts,
though.

**AI experts:** A far greater share of men than women say they are _more excited_ than concerned
(53% vs. 30%). While just 11% of men say they’re _more concerned_ than excited, that ticks up to

24% of women.

**U.S. public:** Men are again more likely than women to say they are more excited than concerned
(15% vs. 7%). While 46% of men are more concerned, that rises slightly to 55% among women.

In in-depth interviews, we asked AI experts about what uses of AI excite them, and why. Some
themes include making life easier or more efficient and improving outcomes for certain industries.
(Quotes have been lightly edited for grammar and clarity.)

Quotes from AI experts: Reasons for excitement about AI

_“I think broadly some of the things that excite me are things like applications that can save people a lot of_

_time from repetitive and mundane tasks. So I think automating some of those workflows.”_

_“I’ve seen that the AI can improve a lot the accuracy of the diagnosis of different diseases. Also, it can_

_boost the development of different medicines for different treatments. Like for instance, for breast cancer_

_classification, it can improve a lot. It can decrease the false positive rates and false negative rates. Most_

_excited about the positive impact that it could have in the health industry.”_

www.pewresearch.org

26

PEW RESEARCH CENTER

And we also asked experts what uses of AI concern them, and why. Some themes include data
privacy and misinformation.

Quotes from AI experts: Reasons for concern about AI

_“I do think about how that [airport biometrics] technology is used, especially from a privacy and security_

_standpoint. ... Where’s that data going? How is it being housed? Where is it being used for? Where is my_

_consent? Can I really, truly say no, I don’t want my_ _picture taken, but what is the consequence of me saying_

_that and still trying to make it to my flight at home?”_

_“Misinformation has always been an issue with technology. … But I think the main issue with AI and_

_misinformation is that you can now do misinformation at scale, at a way larger scale.”_

A [2021 Center survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/03/17/how-americans-think-about-artificial-intelligence/) found that some related themes also arose among U.S. adults when asked
why they were either more concerned or more excited.

Specific concerns about AI

Our new survey also gives us the chance to compare expert and public concern in several key
areas, including those related to “deepfakes,” misinformation, job displacement and AI bias.

www.pewresearch.org

**The public is more worried**
**about losing jobs – and**

**human connection – than**

**AI experts.** [Continuing a](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/03/17/how-americans-think-about-artificial-intelligence/ps_2022-03-17_ai-he_01-02-png/)

work. More than half of U.S.

adults are extremely or very
concerned about AI eliminating
jobs, versus a smaller share of
experts surveyed (56% vs.

loss of human connection more

than experts do (57% vs. 37%).

There are gender differences
on specific concerns about AI
as well. Some of the biggest

are on data misuse, bias and

inaccurate information.

On the other hand, women feel

similarly to men about
impersonation and job loss.

By gender, among U.S. adults and AI experts surveyed

Men stand out for thinking they’ll benefit from AI in both groups we surveyed.

Among U.S. adults, men are more likely to foresee personal benefit than women (31% vs. 18%).
This gender difference is also present among the experts surveyed (81% vs. 64%).

Many of the conversations around harm in AI center around potential biases related to race,
ethnicity and gender. These include examples from hiring algorithms to medical decision-making.

One way AI companies are dealing with potential racial and gender biases in their models is by
[improving how models are trained. At the same time, there are also calls for more diverse](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/16/how-to-reduce-ai-bias-according-to-tech-expert.html)
[workforces](https://time.com/charter/6344366/how-to-make-ai-more-diverse/) to [counteract bias. These efforts, though, have been met with pushback as companies](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/us/diversity-artificial-intelligence-bias-reaj/index.html)

scale back these initiatives.

We explored how the public and experts view the representation of six groups in this light, with
questions we first asked in 2021. [3]

3 [Our survey focused on race, ethnicity and gender because these feature in prominent examples of AI bias](https://time.com/5520558/artificial-intelligence-racial-gender-bias/) and due to constraints on survey
space. However, there are a range of dimensions relevant to bias in AI.

www.pewresearch.org

PEW RESEARCH CENTER


How well are the views of racial and ethnic

groups represented?

Both experts and the public believe White
adults’ views are better-represented than other
groups’ when it comes to AI design:

- 73% of experts we surveyed say the people
designing AI take the experiences and views

of White adults into account at least

somewhat well.

- Half say the same for Asian adults and even

smaller shares about Black (27%) or

Hispanic (25%) adults.

The public is more uncertain than experts with
roughly four-in-ten or more unsure about these

issues. But the views of White adults’

representation again stand out:

- Four-in-ten U.S. adults say the perspectives

of White adults are well-considered.

- Fewer say this about the views of Asian
(25%), Black (19%) or Hispanic (17%)

adults.

We saw similar patterns in which groups stand
[out as well-represented the last time we asked](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/03/17/how-americans-think-about-artificial-intelligence/ps_2022-03-17_ai-he_01-05-png/)

_By race and ethnicity, among U.S. adults and AI experts surveyed_

Differences by race and ethnicity among the general public are mostly modest. Refer to Appendix

B for how these views break down.

Among experts, there were not enough Black or Hispanic experts surveyed to be broken out into a
separate analysis – reflecting the [racial and ethnic makeup](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-index-diversity-report-unmoving-needle) of the field as a whole. As always, these
groups’ responses are incorporated into the general figures for experts’ views throughout this

report.

How well are the views of men and women represented?

Considerable attention has been paid to women’s representation in the tech workforce – with
many seeing them as underrepresented.

Both the public and the experts we surveyed see the views of women as less well-represented than
men’s. Three-quarters of experts say the views of men are taken into account at least somewhat
well by AI designers. In contrast, 44% say this about women’s views.

Again, the public is notably uncertain – about four-in-ten adults are unsure how well these views
are accounted for. Still, they see men’s views as better accounted for than women’s (42% vs. 27%).

We also asked experts and the public to consider if AI could perform and even improve upon jobs
traditionally done by humans. In a number of cases, experts are more optimistic.

# 3. Public and expert predictions for AI’s next 20 years

The rapid rise of artificial intelligence promises to transform many aspects of life, from education
and work to personal connections. Over the next 20 years, AI advancements will continue. But
whether this leads to excitement or concern or brings more benefits than harm is highly debated.

This chapter examines how the American public and experts anticipate AI’s impact across key
areas in the coming decades.

There are many predictions for what AI may bring. However, the public and experts don’t see eye
to eye on the type of impact AI will have on the country.


Fully 56% of AI experts
surveyed say AI will have a
very or somewhat positive
impact on the United States
over the next 20 years. This
compares with 17% among the
general public.

Conversely, 35% of U.S. adults
believe AI will negatively affect
the country over the next two
decades, compared with 15%
of experts.


Note: “AI experts” refer to individuals whose work or research relates to AI. The AI experts
surveyed are those who were authors or presenters at an AI-related conference in 2023 or
2024 and live in the U.S. Expert views are only representative of those who responded. For

By gender, among AI experts surveyed and U.S. adults


There are substantial gender
differences among experts on
AI’s potential impact on the

country.

Among AI experts surveyed,
men are far more likely than

women to say AI’s impact
would be positive (63% vs.

36%).

Female experts are more likely
than their male counterparts
to predict negative outcomes

(23% vs. 12%) or to foresee an

equal mix of both (36% vs.

19%).

Gender gaps are also present
among U.S. adults, but they

are far more modest than the

differences seen among

experts.

positively impact elections in the U.S. over the next 20 years. In fact, 61% of these experts believe
AI will _harm_ elections in the future, with 50% of the public saying the same.

News is also an area where small shares of experts (18%) and the public (10%) believe it will be a
good thing for the country. About half or more of experts (56%) and the public (51%) predict it will
negatively affect the news people get.

It’s also worth noting that the general public is generally more unsure of their predictions. For

jobs over the next 20 years.

And among both experts and

Quotes from AI experts: Job loss

_“[AI] is going to take over a lot of jobs. Of course it’s creating new jobs, but that doesn’t mean it’s matching_

_that. We’re generating maybe 10 jobs, but at the same time, we’re taking away 1,000 jobs. For example,_

_truck drivers, they’ll be gone in 10, 20 years probably, if you think. Are we going to replace them? What_

_are they going to do?”_

The public is more pessimistic about medical doctors and teachers than AI experts. For example,
43% of adults overall say AI will lead to fewer teacher jobs in the next 20 years, compared with
31% of experts. This pattern is similar when asked about medical doctors.

AI experts are more pessimistic about legal fields: 38% of AI experts say AI will lead to fewer jobs
for lawyers, while 23% of the general public agrees.

The public is generally more likely than AI experts to say they are unsure about AI’s impact on the
number of jobs in these industries. For instance, about one-in-five or more U.S. adults say they are
unsure of the type of impact AI will have on mental health therapists (26%), truck drivers (21%) or
journalists (19%).

Overview

Data in this report comes from Wave 152 of the American Trends Panel (ATP), Pew Research
Center’s nationally representative panel of randomly selected U.S. adults. The survey was
conducted from Aug. 12 to Aug. 18, 2024. A total of 5,410 panelists responded out of 5,961 who
were sampled, for a survey-level response rate of 91%.

The cumulative response rate accounting for nonresponse to the recruitment surveys and attrition
is 3%. The break-off rate among panelists who logged on to the survey and completed at least one
item is 1%. The margin of sampling error for the full sample of 5,410 respondents is plus or minus

1.6 percentage points.

The survey includes an [oversample of Hispanic men, non-Hispanic Black men and non-Hispanic](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/25/oversampling-is-used-to-study-small-groups-not-bias-poll-results/)
Asian adults in order to provide more precise estimates of the opinions and experiences of these
smaller demographic subgroups. These oversampled groups are weighted back to reflect their
correct proportions in the population.

SSRS conducted the survey for Pew Research Center via online (n=5,195) and live telephone
(n=215) interviewing. Interviews were conducted in both English and Spanish.

To learn more about the ATP, read “About the American Trends Panel.”

Panel recruitment

Since 2018, the ATP has used address-based sampling (ABS) for recruitment. A study cover letter
and a pre-incentive are mailed to a stratified, random sample of households selected from the U.S.
Postal Service’s Computerized Delivery Sequence File. This Postal Service file has been estimated
to cover 90% to 98% of the population. [5] Within each sampled household, the adult with the next

birthday is selected to participate. Other details of the ABS recruitment protocol have changed
over time but are available upon request. [6] Prior to 2018, the ATP was recruited using landline and
cellphone random-digit-dial surveys administered in English and Spanish.

A national sample of U.S. adults has been recruited to the ATP approximately once per year since
2014. In some years, the recruitment has included additional efforts (known as an “oversample”)
to improve the accuracy of data for underrepresented groups. For example, Hispanic adults, Black
adults and Asian adults were oversampled in 2019, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

Sample design

The overall target population for this survey was noninstitutionalized persons ages 18 and older
living in the United States. It featured a stratified random sample from the ATP in which Hispanic
men, non-Hispanic Black men and non-Hispanic Asian adults were selected with certainty. The
remaining panelists were sampled at rates designed to ensure that the share of respondents in
each stratum is proportional to its share of the U.S. adult population to the greatest extent
possible. Respondent weights are adjusted to account for differential probabilities of selection as
described in the Weighting section below.

Questionnaire development and testing

The questionnaire was developed by Pew Research Center in consultation with SSRS. The web
program used for online respondents was rigorously tested on both PC and mobile devices by the
SSRS project team and Pew Research Center researchers. The SSRS project team also populated
test data that was analyzed in SPSS to ensure the logic and randomizations were working as
intended before launching the survey.

Incentives

All respondents were offered a post-paid incentive for their participation. Respondents could
choose to receive the post-paid incentive in the form of a check or gift code to Amazon.com.
Incentive amounts ranged from $5 to $15 depending on whether the respondent belongs to a part
of the population that is harder or easier to reach. Differential incentive amounts were designed to
increase panel survey participation among groups that traditionally have low survey response

propensities.

Data collection protocol

The data collection field period for this survey was Aug. 12 to Aug. 18, 2024. Surveys were
conducted via self-administered web survey or by live telephone interviewing.

**For panelists who take surveys online:** [7] Postcard notifications were mailed to a subset on
Aug. 12. [8] Survey invitations were sent out in two separate launches: soft launch and full launch.
Sixty panelists were included in the soft launch, which began with an initial invitation sent on Aug.
12. All remaining English- and Spanish-speaking sampled online panelists were included in the
full launch and were sent an invitation on Aug. 13.

PEW RESEARCH CENTER

Panelists participating online were sent an email invitation and up to two email reminders if they
did not respond to the survey. ATP panelists who consented to SMS messages were sent an SMS
invitation with a link to the survey and up to two SMS reminders.

**For panelists who take surveys over the phone with a live interviewer:** Prenotification
postcards were mailed on Aug. 7, and reminder postcards were mailed on Aug. 12. The CATI soft
launch took place on Aug. 12 and involved dialing until a total of eight interviews had been
completed. All remaining English- and Spanish-speaking sampled CATI panelist numbers were
dialed throughout the remaining field period. CATI panelists receive up to six calls from trained

SSRS interviewers.

Data quality checks

To ensure high-quality data, Center researchers performed data quality checks to identify any
respondents showing patterns of satisficing. This includes checking for whether respondents left

to the last two years who opt to continue receiving postcard notifications.

questions blank at very high rates or always selected the first or last answer presented. As a result
of this checking, five ATP respondents were removed from the survey dataset prior to weighting
and analysis.

Weighting


The ATP data is weighted in a
process that accounts for
multiple stages of sampling and
nonresponse that occur at
different points in the panel
survey process. First, each
panelist begins with a base
weight that reflects their
probability of recruitment into
the panel. These weights are
then calibrated to align with the
population benchmarks in the
accompanying table to correct
for nonresponse to recruitment
surveys and panel attrition. If
only a subsample of panelists
was invited to participate in the
wave, this weight is adjusted to
account for any differential
probabilities of selection.

Among the panelists who completed the survey, this weight is then calibrated again to align with
the population benchmarks identified in the accompanying table. The weight is then trimmed at
approximately the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce the loss in precision stemming from variance
in the weights. Sampling errors and tests of statistical significance take into account the effect of
weighting.

The survey of artificial intelligence (AI) experts is a national survey of 1,013 AI experts living in the
United States, conducted for Pew Research Center by SSRS. Expert responses are unweighted and
are only representative of the views of those who responded. The survey was administered online
in English from Aug. 14 to Oct. 31, 2024.

For this study, the population of AI experts is defined as U.S.-based individuals whose work or
research relates to artificial intelligence and who presented at or published in any of 21 different

AI-focused conferences in 2023 and 2024.

Because there is no definitive source of population benchmarks for this group, responses from the
expert survey are unweighted. They are only representative of the views of experts who responded
to the survey. Appendix A has a detailed demographic profile of responses we received, including
by gender, race and ethnicity, employment status, and sector.

The margin of sampling error for the complete sample of 1,013 respondents is plus or minus 3.1

percentage points.

Sample design

There is no readily available list of AI experts living in the United States that could serve as a
sampling frame for this survey. To create the sample, Center researchers compiled a list of authors
and presenters from a wide range of AI-focused conferences from 2023 and 2024. These
conferences cover topics related to artificial intelligence, including research, development,
application, and ethical and social science implications. The list was developed in consultation
with external advisers on the project (refer to the end of this methodology) and was designed to
capture as diverse and wide a range of perspectives on AI as possible. The final selection was the
following 21 conferences: [9]

- Ai4 (2023)

- International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations (AIAI) (2024)

- AI and Algorithms in Government Conference (2024)

- AI and Big Data Expo North America (2023)

- AI Hardware and Edge AI Summit (2023)

- AI and Society Conference: Government Policy and Law at the University of Missouri (2024)

- AI and Tech Live (2023)

Center researchers compiled a list of every individual who presented at or whose research was
published in the proceedings of each conference _._ For many conferences, including AAAI, NeurIPS,
FAccT and AIES, the list of participants was obtained from published conference proceedings
which typically included names, affiliations and email addresses for the authors of each paper. For
conferences in which the proceedings were not available or did not exist, the publicly available
speaker list was used.

Individuals who were identified as living outside the U.S. based on their organizational affiliation
or email address were excluded from the list. When U.S. residency was uncertain, researchers
consulted professional profiles, LinkedIn, personal websites and other sources of publicly available

information to make a determination.

For individuals whose email address was not available through conference proceedings, an email
finder service was used to obtain contact information. Researchers made multiple passes through
the list of names in order to include as many email addresses as possible for the sample. ~~Finally~~,
~~the~~ ~~sample~~ ~~was~~ ~~processed~~ ~~a~~ n ~~d~~ c ~~le~~ a ~~n~~ e ~~d~~ t ~~o~~ ~~identify~~ ~~and~~ ~~remove~~ ~~any~~ ~~duplicates~~ .

www.pewresearch.org

60

PEW RESEARCH CENTER

Altogether, this process identified a total of 8,377 individuals ~~that~~ ~~were~~ ~~potentially~~ ~~eligible~~ ~~to~~
~~participate~~ ~~in~~ ~~the~~ ~~survey~~ . Researchers were able to obtain email addresses for 7,933 of the
individuals, for a collection rate of 94.7%, all of whom were included in the sample.

~~Screening~~ ~~and~~ ~~eligibility~~

To confirm eligibility, at the beginning of the survey respondents were asked two questions: (1) if
their work or research relates in any way to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, or related
topics; (2) if they currently live in the United States. Respondents were deemed eligible if they
responded yes to both questions. If respondents indicated that their work or research does not
relate in any way to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, or related topics; or do not live in
the U.S.; or refused to answer either screening question, they were deemed ineligible and the
interview was terminated. A total of 29 respondents were determined to be ineligible based on this

screener.

Data collection

An initial soft launch was conducted in which survey invitations were sent to 200 cases on Aug. 14,
2024. A second batch of 400 cases was sent the following day, Aug. 15. Sampled individuals were
invited via email to take the survey online in English. The invitation included links to the survey
and FAQs about the study. The email also included a link allowing respondents to unsubscribe if
they did not wish to participate in the study.

The soft launch yielded very few completed interviews and prompted us to make several changes
to the data collection protocol. We paused data collection until after the start of the fall academic
year in the hope that academic researchers would be easier to contact. The survey invitations were
also revised to be more appealing and emphasize topic salience.

We also conducted an experiment to determine if the addition of an incentive would improve
completion rates. Invitations for the incentive experiment were emailed to a total of 400 cases on
Sept. 20, 2024, in which a random half were offered a $25 Visa virtual gift card if they completed
the survey and the remainder were not offered an incentive. Based on the results of the
experiment, a $25 post-paid incentive in the form of a Visa gift card was incorporated into the
final data collection protocol.

PEW RESEARCH CENTER

Pew Research Center worked with SSRS to conduct 30 individual in-depth interviews between
Oct. 18 and Nov. 26, 2024. The goal of these was to further explore the views of AI experts on
topics we covered in the survey – including the societal impact of AI, representation in the AI
workforce, bias in AI models and issues of regulation and responsible use of AI. The interviews
were also designed to hear from AI experts across a range of different demographic dimensions,
including race, ethnicity and gender. However, the in-depth interviews are not representative of
any demographic group or AI experts as a whole.

Interview recruitment

AI experts were recruited at the end of the survey of AI experts described above. A single question
asked AI experts if they would be willing to take part in an online interview for Pew Research
Center to get more detail on the topic of AI and ensure that the researchers hear from a range of
voices. The question also provided information about how long the interview would be, how
information would be used and compensation.

AI experts who indicated they were willing to participate in an interview were then asked if they
could complete an online interview and had access to a computer or mobile device where they
could access Zoom, high speed internet, and a quiet and private space from which they could
participate uninterrupted. For scheduling purposes, they were also asked for their contact

information.

www.pewresearch.org

63

PEW RESEARCH CENTER

Overall, 57% of AI experts surveyed indicated they were willing to
participate in an interview, and all met criteria to participate.
Center researchers worked with SSRS to prioritize participants
for scheduling.

In line with the goals of the project, a roughly equal number of
participants across race and ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic,
Asian) and gender (men and women) were selected, along with a
mix of job sectors.

On a rolling basis, SSRS provided Center researchers with ID
numbers and corresponding demographic information from
those who agreed to participate. Center researchers then provided

SSRS with selected ID numbers to contact and interview.

Interviews

Four professional moderators conducted the online interviews in
English on behalf of SSRS and Pew Research Center. White, Black
and Asian experts were matched with moderators of the same
race as them. Hispanic experts were matched with a Hispanic

moderator.

Each moderator followed the same interview guide, which covered four topics:

- AI’s impact on society today and in the future

- Representation among AI designers

- Bias in AI

- Regulating AI

The full interview guide is available upon request.

Interviews were conducted online using Zoom. Each interview lasted for approximately 30
minutes. Each participant received a $100 Visa virtual gift card. The interviews were recorded.
After each interview, SSRS provided the audio recording and transcript to Center researchers.
Transcripts were anonymized and any identifying information was removed.

PEW RESEARCH CENTER

Analysis

Four Center researchers reviewed the audio recordings and transcripts to create a coding scheme
based on the content in the interviews to help identify key quotations for inclusion in the report.
After the coding scheme was established, each researcher coded one transcript independently,
then discussed their coding of this transcript together to ensure that the coding scheme was being
used similarly across researchers. The coding scheme was modified and refined for accuracy and
clarity. The remaining transcripts were then divided among the researchers and coded
independently.

After all transcripts were coded, codes were reviewed to identify common themes across
interviews. Based on the common themes, quotations were selected that represented the themes or
provided details to complement survey findings on a similar topic.

Quotations featured in the report have been lightly edited for grammar and clarity. Quotations are
not representative of larger demographic groups; instead, they are intended to provide details on
individual experts’ views of AI. Views expressed by participants have not been fact-checked.

In addition to a team of subject area and methodological experts at Pew Research Center, the
project was also guided by an advisory board of three members. This board included experts in a
variety of areas related to artificial intelligence, including computer science, ethics, biases and

other areas:

  Shreya Singh Hernández, Data Equity Lead, Aspen Digital, Aspen Institute

  - Nicol Turner Lee, ~~Director~~ ~~of~~ ~~Technology~~ ~~Innovation~~, ~~Brookings~~ ~~Institut~~ i ~~o~~ n

Advisers provided feedback at various key points during the report, including on the sample
design, the questionnaire and a draft of the report. Pew Research Center remains solely
responsible for all aspects of the research, including any errors associated with its products and
findings. The feedback shared for this project is solely that of the advisers and does not express the
