## **Majority of Australians believe artificial intelligence (AI) ** **creates more problems than it solves **

**A special Roy Morgan SMS Survey of 1,481 Australians aged 16+, conducted in conjunction with the**
**Campaign for AI Safety, shows a sizeable majority of 57% of Australians believe artificial intelligence**
**(AI) creates more problems than it solves.**

**One in five (20%) Australians believe AI presents a risk of human extinction in the next twenty years.**

### **AI 'creates more problems ** **than it solves'**
## **4 3%** **57%** Agree Disagree

### **AI 'presents a risk of ** **human extinction in the ** **next two decades'**
## **20%** **80%** Yes No


**Source** : Roy Morgan Snap SMS Survey: August 9-11, 2023. **Base** : Australians 16+, n=1,481. Weighted results.

**Females, older Australians, and regional Australians are more sceptical of AI**

Females (62%) are far more likely to agree that artificial intelligence (AI) creates more problems than it
solves, compared to males (52%).

A large majority of those aged over 50 also agreed, (65% of 50-64-year-olds and 64% of those aged
65+); whilst only a slim majority of younger Australians agreed (51% of those aged under 35).

Those in regional and rural areas were more likely to be sceptical of artificial intelligence (AI) than those
in the capital cities. A clear majority of 61% of people in regional and rural Australia agreed that AI
creates more problems than it solves, compared to 56% of those in the capital cities.

**One in five (20%) Australians believe AI presents a risk of human extinction in the next two**
**decades – though many are less worried**

While a clear majority of 80% of Australians say that artificial intelligence (AI) **does not** pose a risk of
human extinction in the next two decades, 20% say **yes, it does** .

This breakdown is fairly consistent across different demographics but there are some groups that are
more likely than others to say that AI poses a threat of extinction in the next twenty years including

A.B.N. 91 007 092 944  I  Head Office: Tonic House: 386 Flinders Lane, Melbourne Vic 3000  I  Telephone: +61 (3) 9629 6888  I **www.roymorgan.com**

respondents aged 50-64 (25%), and respondents in Tasmania (37%), Western Australia and Perth (both
26%) and Melbourne (24%).

Those respondents who agreed that AI creates more problems than it solves were around three times
more likely to say AI poses the risk of human extinction (28%) compared to 10% for those who disagree
that AI creates more problems than it solves.

**Job losses and the need for greater regulation are seen as the biggest reasons AI creates**
**more problems than it solves**

Among those who agreed that AI creates more problems than it solves (57% of respondents), the most
common reasons given for agreeing with this statement was the potential for job losses, followed by the
need for regulation and the ability for AI to be misused.

Examples of open-ended reasons given by respondents for why they agree that AI creates more
problems than it solves are:

_“AI will create unemployment and further stupefy the population. Meanwhile we allow a technology_
_with a greater capability to change life as humans have known it for millennia.”_

_“It creates more excuses to stop funding our education system and takes away jobs from those_
_who have built their skills around writing.”_

_“I think it’s not well regulated and the issues have not been thought thorough so that now the_
_technology has sped ahead of our thinking with regards to ethics, plagiarism, creativity and jobs.”_

_“It is an unregulated technology that can cause great harm when used by business and_
_governments in a detrimental, criminal manner.”_

_“Problems lie in how we use and regulate AI, not AI itself – like nuclear technology, guns or knives.”_

_“In current times when society’s norms and values are so blurred and there are no practical checks_
_on where and how AI is used, it creates many options to abuse this technology.”_

_“The concepts of AI itself and what it can achieve sounds wonderful, but we live in a fallen world_
_and there is unfortunately the potential for AI to become corrupted or used for the wrong purposes.”_

_“It is too easy for it to be used by corrupt individuals and organisations for dishonest purposes.”_

_“As the law is not keeping up with AI we need laws to protect our rights to privacy, and to protect_
_our children from any form of surveillance, abuse, intimidation or misuse of AI.”_

**Base** : Agreed that AI creates more problems than it solves, n=903. Weighted results. Top 5 reasons shown.

**Those that believe that AI solves more problems than it creates believe AI will lead to a**
**better society, and can be beneficial when used correctly**

Among those who believe that AI solves more problems than it creates (43% of respondents), the most
common reasons given are for the potential betterment of society, that the technology is beneficial if
used correctly, and that the pros outweigh the cons.

Examples of open-ended reasons given by respondents for why they agree that AI solves more
problems than it creates are:

_“It will be useful for solutions to all sorts of problems that we haven’t solved yet. It can aid us and_
_we should be cautious but not scared of the future.”_

_“If programmed properly complex decision making should be better because of the amount of_
_data that AI can process. Phone apps to encourage medicine adherence in remote areas would_
_be fantastic – there are many positive uses of AI.”_

_“Because AI has the potential to tackle the most difficult social and environmental challenges_
_especially in the computer science areas.”_

_“AI now runs nearly all infrastructure that helps create a better society. It provides convenience_
_and security.”_

_“As a human race we thrive and grow on innovation and progress. I believe if used with controls_
_AI can be extremely beneficial.”_

_“It’s too early to tell, but so far the conveniences from AI have been beneficial.”_

_“There are far more instances where AI has been beneficial rather than a problem.”_

_“People using AI may create problems, not the AI technology itself. It can be so beneficial when_
_used correctly in art, automation, learning. Endless possibilities to grow and aid human capability.”_

_“AI has the potential to improve everyone’s lives, and I believe there is still time to regulate against_
_at least some of the harm that it may do.”_

_“It is part of the progression of technology that on the whole continually improves our quality of life.”_










**Source** : Roy Morgan Snap SMS Survey: 9-11 August 2023.

**Base** : Disagreed that AI creates more problems than it solves, n=578. Weighted results. Top 5 reasons shown.

**Roy Morgan CEO Michele Levine says that while many Australians see the benefits of new**
**Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, they are also concerned about the risks and see a clear**
**need for tighter regulation.**

_"Australians are excited about the benefits that AI technology can bring to everyday life, but on_
_the balance, the majority of us feel the potential for job losses, misuse, and inaccuracy outweigh_
_these benefits._

_“Australians feel there is a clear need for regulation in the AI space, to ensure that these risks_
_can be adequately managed._

_“Surprisingly, one in five (20%) of us are so concerned about the rise of AI, that we think there is_
_a real risk of the extinction of the human race at the hands of AI in the next two decades.”_

**Nik Samoylov, coordinator of the Campaign for AI Safety** _,_ **says that the poll shows widespread**
**community apprehension about AI, especially when it comes to job security.**

_"Most Australians are pessimistic about artificial intelligence, especially when it comes to job_
_security and opportunities for misuse._

_“The poll suggests that people want government regulation to deal with these issues, including_
_unknown consequences and new problems that AI will create._

_“One in five Australians anticipates the risk of human extinction from AI in the next twenty years._
_The Australian government does not have time to delay AI regulation, nor to delay banning the_
_development of dangerous AI that can be misused or cause grave accidents.”_

This special Roy Morgan Snap SMS survey was conducted in conjunction with the ‘Campaign for AI
Safety’ with an Australia-wide cross-section of 1,481 Australians aged 16+ from 9–11 August 2023.

**Margin of Error**

The margin of error to be allowed for in any estimate depends mainly on the number of interviews on which
it is based. Margin of error gives indications of the likely range within which estimates would be 95% likely
to fall, expressed as the number of percentage points above or below the actual estimate. Allowance for
design effects (such as stratification and weighting) should be made as appropriate.
