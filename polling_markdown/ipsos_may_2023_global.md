A 31-country Global Advisor survey

July 2023

###### **Summary findings**


**Understanding of AI**
~~**is**~~ ~~**still**~~ ~~**lagg**~~ **i** ~~**n**~~ **g**

- On average across the 31
countries surveyed, twothirds say they have a good
understanding of what AI is,
but only half say they know
what products and services
use AI.

- Knowledge of which
products and services use
AI is higher among younger
~~adults~~, ~~men~~, ~~those~~ ~~who~~ ~~are~~
employed, more educated,
and/or more affluent.

- In a typical pattern,
familiarity with AI-powered
products and services
ranges from over 70% in
Indonesia and Malaysia to
just 35% in Belgium, New
Zealand, and the United
States.

- Reported understanding of
AI has increased over the

past 18 months, particularly
in Europe, but familiarity
with which products and
services use AI has not.


**Mixed feelings and**
~~**increased**~~

**nervousness**

- Globally, only about half
agree that products and
services using AI have
more benefits than

drawbacks (54%) and are
excited about them (also
54%).

- However, about the same
number (52%) are nervous
about them, up 13 points
~~from~~ ~~18~~ ~~months~~ ~~ago~~ .

- Excitement is highest in
emerging markets and
lowest in Europe and North
America; it is also higher
among Gen Zers and
Millennials, as well as the
college educated.

- Nervousness is highest in
all predominantly
Anglophone countries and
lowest in Japan, Korea and
Eastern Europe.


**… but 2 in 3 expect it**
~~**will**~~ ~~**soon**~~ ~~**change**~~ ~~**it**~~
**profoundly**

- On average, 66% agree
that AI-powered products
and services will
significantly change their
daily life in the next 3-5
years, including majorities
in all countries (from 82% in
South Korea to 51% in
France) and all
demographic groups (but
especially among the more
affluent and those with a
college education).

- Among workers, 57%
expect AI to change the
way they do their current
job and 36% expect it to
replace their current job.

- The percentage of workers
expecting major disruptions
is highest in Southeast Asia
and lowest in Northern
Europe (with differences of
up to 50 points) and is also
much higher among those
who are younger and/or
decision makers than
among those who are not.


**Not all changes are**
~~**expected**~~ ~~**to**~~ ~~**be**~~ ~~**for**~~ ~~**the**~~
**better**

- Globally, slightly more than
half expect that increased
use of AI will give them
more time to get things
done and improve their
entertainment options.

- Only 1 in 3 or slightly more
say it will improve their
health, their job, and their
country's economy.

- More say it will make the
job market worse than
better.

- Again, optimism about AI is
much higher in the Global
South than in high-income
countries, and among
younger and highly
educated adults than

among those who are older
or have no college
education.


**Wide geographic**
~~**differences**~~ ~~**in**~~ ~~**trust**~~

- Trust in AI varies widely by
region; it is generally much
higher in emerging markets
and among people under
40 than in high-income
countries and among Gen
Xers and Boomers.

- People's trust that
companies using AI will
protect their personal
~~information~~ ~~ranges~~ ~~from~~
72% in Thailand to just 32%
in France, Japan, and the
U.S.

- The percentage of people
who trust that AI will not

discriminate against groups
of people shows an even
wider spread across
countries.


**Just half say AI has**
~~**impacted**~~ ~~**their**~~ ~~**life**~~ ~~**in**~~
**the past few years…**

- Globally, just half (49%) say
that AI-based products and
services have significantly
changed their daily live in
the past 3 to 5 years, about
the same percentage as in
December 2021.

- In South Korea and across

Southeast Asia, the
percentage feeling this way
~~is~~ ~~about~~ ~~35~~ ~~to~~ ~~40~~

percentage points higher
than most countries across

Northwestern Europe and
North America.

- It is also, on average, at
least 20 points higher
among Gen Zers and
Millennials than among
Boomers.

###### **Methodology**

 - These are the findings of a 31-country Ipsos survey conducted on Ipsos’s

Global Advisor online survey platform and, in India, on its hybrid
IndiaBus, May 26 – June 9, 2023, among 22,816 adults aged 18 and
older in India, 18-74 in Canada, the Republic of Ireland, Malaysia, New
Zealand, South Africa, Turkey, and the United States, 20-74 in Thailand,
21-74 in Indonesia and Singapore, and 16-74 in 20 other countries.

 - Each country’s sample consists of ca. 1,000 individuals in each of

Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan,
New Zealand, Spain, and the U.S.; and ca. 500 individuals in each of
Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland,
Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Romania, Singapore,
~~South~~ ~~Africa~~, ~~South~~ ~~Korea~~, ~~Sweden~~, ~~Thailand~~, ~~and~~ ~~Turkey~~ . ~~The~~ ~~sample~~ ~~in~~
India consists of approximately 2,200 individuals, of whom ca. 1,800
were interviewed face-to-face and 400 were interviewed online.

 - The samples in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,

Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Poland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the U.S. can be taken as
representative of these countries’ general adult population under the age
of 75.

 - The samples in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico,

Peru, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey are more
urban, more educated, and/or more affluent than the general population.
The survey results for these markets should be viewed as reflecting the
views of the more “connected” segment of their population.

- India’s sample represents a large subset of its urban population – socio
economic classes A, B, and C, in metros and tier 1-3 town classes
across all the country’s four zones.

- The data is weighted so that each market’s sample composition best

reflects the demographic profile of the adult population according to the
most recent census data.

- The “global country average” or “31-country average” reflects the

average result of all the countries where the survey was conducted. It
has not been adjusted to the population size of each country or market
and is not intended to suggest a total result.
