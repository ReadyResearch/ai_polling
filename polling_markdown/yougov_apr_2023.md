5. More than 1,000 technology leaders recently signed an open letter calling on researchers to pause development of certain large-scale AI systems for at least six months world-wide, citing fears of the "profound risks to
society and humanity." Would you support or oppose a six-month pause on some kinds of AI development?

**Interviewing Dates** April 7 - 11, 2023

**Target population** U.S. citizens, aged 18 and over.

**Sampling method** Respondents were selected from YouGov’s opt-in Internet panel using sample matching. A random sample (stratified by gender, age,
race, education, geographic region, and voter registration) was selected from the 2019 American Community Survey.

**Weighting** The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education,
2020 election turnout and Presidential vote, baseline party identification, and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting
targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. Baseline
party identification is the respondent’s most recent answer given prior
to March 15, 2022, and is weighted to the estimated distribution at
that time (33% Democratic, 28% Republican). The weights range
from 0.235 to 3.791, with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of

0.413.

**Number of respondents** 1000

**Margin of error** _±_ 3.4% (adjusted for weighting)

**Survey mode** Web-based interviews

**Questions not reported** 74 questions not reported.

# **YouGov Survey: AI and the End of Humanity**

**April 7 - 11, 2023 - 1000 U.S. adult citizens**

**Interviewing Dates** April 7 - 11, 2023

**Target population** U.S. citizens, aged 18 and over.

**Sampling method** Respondents were selected from YouGov’s opt-in Internet panel using sample matching. A random sample (stratified by gender, age,
race, education, geographic region, and voter registration) was selected from the 2019 American Community Survey.

**Weighting** The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education,
2020 election turnout and Presidential vote, baseline party identification, and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting
targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. Baseline
party identification is the respondent’s most recent answer given prior
to March 15, 2022, and is weighted to the estimated distribution at
that time (33% Democratic, 28% Republican). The weights range
from 0.235 to 3.791, with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of

0.413.

**Number of respondents** 1000

**Margin of error** _±_ 3.4% (adjusted for weighting)

**Survey mode** Web-based interviews

**Questions not reported** 74 questions not reported.
