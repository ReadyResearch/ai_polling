****There is a debate on whether regulations should explicitly**

**that the burden of proof for safety should fall on the AI tech**

**simply waiting for dangerous models to be released could be**
**courting disaster. Opponents of restricting the power of AI**

****There is a debate on whether regulations should explicitly**
**restrict how much more powerful AI models are allowed to**
**become. Supporters of restricting the power of AI models say**
**that the burden of proof for safety should fall on the AI tech**
**companies. They say that the models being created by AI**
**companies might be excessively risky and dangerous, and**
**simply waiting for dangerous models to be released could be**
**courting disaster. Opponents of restricting the power of AI**
**models say that we can decide on proper regulation when/if**
**models become dangerous. They say that limiting model**
**power is incredibly difficult to do with regulation and doing**
**so risks making Western companies fall behind competitors.**
**What do you think? Should regulation restrict how powerful**
**models can become until safety can be assessed?**

Yes, we should restrict how powerful models can become **71**
No, we should not restrict how powerful models can become **11**
