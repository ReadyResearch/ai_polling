# **PUBLIC POLL FINDINGS AND METHODOLOGY **

**About the Study**

These are some of the findings of an Ipsos poll conducted between May 9-15, 2023 on behalf of
Thomson Reuters. For this survey, a sample of 4,415 adults age 18+ from the continental U.S., Alaska,
and Hawaii was interviewed online in English. The sample also includes 2,089 Democrats, 1,642
Republicans, and 477 independents.

~~The~~ ~~sample~~ ~~was~~ ~~randomly~~ ~~drawn~~ ~~from~~ ~~Ipsos’~~ ~~[online](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/public-opinion-polling-downloads)~~ ~~panel~~, ~~partner~~ ~~online~~ ~~panel~~ ~~sources~~, ~~and~~ ~~“river”~~
~~[sampling](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/public-opinion-polling-downloads)~~ ~~and~~ ~~does~~ ~~not~~ ~~rely~~ ~~on~~ ~~a~~ ~~population~~ ~~frame~~ ~~in~~ ~~the~~ ~~traditional~~ ~~sense~~ . ~~I~~ psos uses fixed sample
targets, unique to each study, in drawing a sample. After a sample has been obtained from the Ipsos
panel, Ipsos calibrates respondent characteristics to be representative of the U.S. Population using
standard procedures such as raking-ratio adjustments. The source of these population targets is U.S.
Census 2022 American Community Survey data. The sample drawn for this study reflects fixed sample
targets on demographics. Posthoc weights were made to the population characteristics on gender, age,
race/ethnicity, region, education and political party affiliation.

Statistical margins of error are not applicable to online non-probability polls. All sample surveys and polls
may be subject to other sources of error, including but not limited to coverage error and measurement
error. Where figures do not sum to 100, this is due to the effects of rounding. The precision of Ipsos
online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll has a credibility interval of plus or
minus 1.8 percentage points for all respondents. Ipsos calculates a design effect (DEFF) for each study
based on the variation of the weights, following the formula of Kish (1965). This study had a credibility
interval adjusted for design effect of the following (n=4,415, DEFF=1.5, adjusted Confidence Interval=+/3.3 percentage points).

The poll also has a credibility interval of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points for Democrats, plus or minus
3.0 percentage points for Republicans, and plus or minus 5.5 percentage points for independents.
