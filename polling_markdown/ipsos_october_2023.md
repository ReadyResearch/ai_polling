A global report from

Google and Ipsos

**January 2024**

Page 2 Our life with AI.
### Foreword.

We are at an inflection point with AI. 2023 brought
breakthroughs across diverse sectors of artificial
intelligence, from the explosion of generative AI
to increasingly sophisticated AI-powered personal

assistants, to advancements in healthcare,
security, and manufacturing. Field-defining and
groundbreaking as these advancements are, we are
just scratching the surface of what AI can do and

what it will become.

At this critical juncture, Google partnered with
Ipsos to understand global public attitudes on AI,

conducting 17,000 interviews across 17 countries.
The results are clear: people across the globe see
immense promise and opportunity from AI today,
tomorrow, and 25 years from now. People across
regions believe AI will have tremendous positive
impact over time, from speeding up workloads to
improving transportation and education to enhancing
quality of life. Our data shows they even believe AI


can address pressing challenges such as climate
change, poverty, and bias and discrimination, while
also making us healthier, smarter, and safer.

As with any new technology, there are some concerns
about AI, both for society and for individuals.
Resoundingly, however, experiencing AI first hand
appears to drive excitement about the boundless
opportunities AI can bring—and calm concerns. To
capture these opportunities and ensure they are
shared and beneficial for all, there is a strong desire
for public-private partnership to best deploy and

develop AI in a responsible way without dampening
the innovation that is so exciting to people around

the world.

Hopefully this report can be a helpful contribution to
the conversation about AI and its impact on society,

the workforce, and individuals as we continue to look
towards a future with artificial intelligence.

#### The reality of today.

Life with AI already looks different. People across
the world are experiencing positive changes in the
way we access information, manage health, learn,
and work. AI’s impact feels the most pronounced
among the online population outside of the
United States and Europe, with the Asia-Pacific
region and emerging markets perceiving the

most positive impact.

#### Around the corner.

The impact of AI now and in the short term is
personal. Individuals expect to benefit personally
from AI in just the next five years:

- More than half (54%) say AI will benefit

“people like me”

- Half (52%) expect AI to have a positive impact

on their own health and wellbeing

- Nearly two thirds (64%) expect disabled people

will benefit from AI in the next five years

- Nearly half (47%) believe AI will benefit

underrepresented groups in the next five years

#### The promise of tomorrow.

Many in the public see AI as a vehicle to build a
healthier, safer, and more knowledgeable world.

Out of a list of potential AI applications, increasing
innovation is a clear priority: medical breakthroughs
(45% very important), climate change solutions (37%),
and R&D (36%) are top priorities and seen as most
important for society.

There are also positive perceived implications for
AI and security (42% very important). AI making us
more secure by detecting fraud, scams, security risks,

and other criminal activity and improving response
to threats outpaces all other applications except
medical breakthroughs as a top application for AI.
Maintaining national security and cybersecurity also
tops the public’s list of government priorities for
the next five years (out of a list of six government
priorities, from protecting privacy to protecting jobs).
The public is looking to the government to harness
AI’s potential and ensure it is leveraged to protect us
from threats and keep us safe.

#### A generation away.

Beyond the near-term benefits, as the public looks
ahead to a future with AI 25 years from now, there
are many perceived upsides from this emerging
technology. In 25 years, more people across the globe
believe AI will have a positive impact than a negative
impact in every sphere tested, from healthcare to
education to addressing poverty and discrimination.

_“In sectors like healthcare and education_
_we’ve not yet seen significant benefits from_
_digital technologies…So I’m particularly_
_excited about the potential for AI to_
_dramatically improve both service and cost_
_in these areas.” ­_ —United Kingdom

_“I’m excited about the breakthroughs in_
_medicine and personal security as well as_
_advancement in the automotive industry.”_
—South Africa

#### Experiencing is believing. How much total positive impact do you think AI is currently having on:

Have used AI **The way we:** Have not used AI


**The way we:**


Using AI contributes to greater excitement and less

concern about a future with AI overall.

More educated and affluent respondents report
greater levels of excitement about the possibilities
of AI (57% excited among higher educated and
55% excited among higher-income respondents),
and at the same time are more likely to have used
AI or discussed AI’s implications in the workplace.
Among those respondents who report using an AI
application in the last year (38%), a majority (68%) is
excited about the possibilities of AI. Those with no
recent experience with an AI program are less likely
to report excitement (38%) and more likely to express
concern about AI (61%). They are also less likely to
feel AI is having a positive impact.

Talking about or using AI at work—from casual

conversations with coworkers about AI to formal

announcements from leadership to AI tools provided


as an option for staff use—also has clear correlations
to attitudes about AI. In the United States, for

example, 36% of workers say they have used or

talked about AI at work, and 33% of Americans are

excited about AI overall. In Germany, by comparison,

62% of workers have used or talked about AI at work,

and 47% of Germans are excited about AI. In Brazil,

75% of workers have used or talked about AI at work,

and 60% of Brazilians are excited about AI.


77% Access information 55%


Younger people also express greater optimism about
AI than older respondents (Gen Z: 59% excited vs.
37% among Baby Boomers). Men are also more
likely to be excited about AI (54%) than women (45%)
overall. Age and gender are also correlated with AI
usage: 43% of men across countries have used an AI
application in the last 12 months, compared to 33% of
women, and 58% of Gen Z have used AI, compared to
just 18% of Boomers.

#### Clear upsides for workers.

Across countries, some workers say AI is already
having an impact on their jobs, allowing them to work
faster or more efficiently.

In five years, workers believe AI will have an even
bigger positive impact on how they work:

- 51% say AI will have a positive impact on their job

(25% no impact / 16% negative impact / 8% don’t
know) in 5 years

- 39% of workers who believe AI will impact their job

or industry believe they will accomplish the same

tasks in less time in 5 years

- 34% of workers who believe AI will impact their

job or industry believe their work will be easier

in 5 years

A majority of blue collar workers (55%) expect positive
changes from AI, as do nearly three quarters (68%) of

white collar workers.

Across countries and regions, workers who believe
AI will impact their job or their industry identify two
main issues in adapting to life with AI: learning how
to use the technology and potential job displacement.
Nearly 1 in 5 of these workers (19%) say they will have
to find an entirely new industry or role to work in in
the next 5 years as a result of AI, and 44% expect they
will have to learn how to use AI for their jobs.

Respondents’ self-projected displacement is highest
among those without a college degree (21%), and

lower income workers (22%). Workers under 35 (21%)

and workers 35-49 (19%) are more likely to say they

will need to find a new industry or role to work in
than those over age 50 (15%).


In each of the 17 countries we surveyed, over 8 in 10
believe AI will change some or most jobs or industries
in the next five years. Of those who believe AI will
change jobs or industries, a majority (52%) feel that
change will likely be a good thing, and 17% remain
uncertain. Countries where respondents are most
likely to think AI will change most jobs and industries
in the next 5 years, such as India and South Africa, also
tend to be the most positive about that change, with
more saying changes in jobs and industries as a result
of AI in the next five years are “probably a good thing”
(75% India / 59% South Africa).

#### Innovation and…

Continuing to innovate as AI develops is a clear
priority. However, while innovation tops the list of
desired AI approaches, innovation is followed by
three words: “responsible,” “safe,” and “cautious.”

Countries that are most likely to gravitate to an
“innovative” approach include Brazil (56%), Mexico
(49%), the United Arab Emirates (48%), and Singapore
(47%). Sweden (46%), Singapore (38%), and South
Africa (35%) are among the countries most likely to
emphasize “responsible” alongside “innovative.”

Total confidence in the following sectors to oversee
the development of AI in the best interest of the public:

67%


There is widespread agreement on the importance
of public-private partnership to responsibly
harness the opportunity AI brings. Three-fourths
of those surveyed (78%) agree that “government
and technology companies should work together
to oversee the development of AI.” There is similar
agreement among the global public that government
and tech companies should work together to ensure
everyone is able to access (74%) and benefit from
(77%) advancements in AI.


It is clear that the public expects various sectors of
society to come together at this critical moment for
AI. Even at a time when trust in government and
institutions is historically low, academic institutions,
branches of government, NGOs, and tech companies
are all trusted to help oversee AI development overall.
