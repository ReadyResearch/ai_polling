### **Summary**

On April 14th 2023, Rethink Priorities conducted an online poll to assess US public

perceptions of, and opinions about, AI risk. The poll was intended to conceptually replicate

and extend a recent AI-related poll from ~~[YouGov](https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/bfoyxp7p28/results_AI%20and%20the%20End%20of%20Humanity.pdf)~~, ~~as~~ ~~well~~ ~~as~~ ~~drawing~~ ~~inspiration~~ ~~from~~ ~~some~~

~~other~~ ~~recent~~ ~~AI~~ ~~polls~~ ~~from~~ ~~[Monmouth](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_021523.pdf/)~~ ~~University~~ ~~and~~ ~~Harris~~ - ~~[MITRE](https://www.mitre.org/news-insights/news-release/mitre-harris-poll-finds-lack-trust-among-americans-ai-technology)~~ .

The poll covered opinions regarding:

1. A pause on certain kinds of AI research

2. Should AI be regulated (akin to the FDA)?

3. Worry about negative effects of AI

4. Extinction risk in 10 and 50 years

5. Likelihood of achieving greater than human level intelligence

6. Perceived most likely existential threats

7. Expected harm vs. good from AI

Our population estimates reflect the responses of 2444 US adults, poststratified to be

representative of the US population. See the Methodology section of the Appendix for

more information on sampling and estimation procedures.

across diferent framings in YouGovf ’s polls). Hence, support is robust across

diferent framings and surveys. The slightly lower level of support in our surveyf

may be explained by our somewhat more neutral framing.

2. **Should AI be regulated (akin to the FDA)?** Many more people think AI should be

regulated than think it should not be. We estimate that 70% believe _Yes_, 21% believe

~~_No_~~ ~~,~~ ~~and~~ ~~9%~~ ~~don~~ ’ ~~t~~ ~~know.~~

3. **Worry about the negative efects of AI.f** Worry in everyday life about the negative

efects of AI appears to be quite low. We estimate 72% of US adults worry little or notf

at all about AI, 21% report a fair amount of worry, and less than 10% worry a lot or

more.

4. **Extinction risk in 10 and 50 years.** Expectation of extinction from AI is relatively

low in the next 10 years but increases in the 50 year time horizon. We estimate 9%

think AI-caused extinction to be moderately likely or more in the next 10 years, and

22% think this in the next 50 years.

~~5.~~ ~~**Likelihood**~~ ~~**of**~~ ~~**achieving**~~ ~~**greater**~~ ~~**than**~~ ~~**human**~~ ~~**level**~~ ~~**intelligence.**~~ ~~Most~~ ~~people~~ ~~think~~

AI will ultimately become more intelligent than people. We estimate 67% think this

moderately likely or more, 40% highly likely or more, and only 15% think it is not at

~~all~~ ~~likely.~~

6. **Perceived most likely existential threats.** AI ranks low among other perceived

existential threats to humanity. AI ranked below all 4 other specifc existential threatsi

~~we~~ ~~asked~~ ~~about,~~ ~~with~~ ~~an~~ ~~estimated~~ ~~4%~~ ~~thinking~~ ~~it~~ ~~the~~ ~~most~~ ~~likely~~ ~~cause~~ ~~of~~ ~~human~~

extinction. For reference, the most likely cause, nuclear war, is estimated to be

                                  -                                  selected by 42% of people. The other least likely cause a pandemic is expected to

be picked by 8% of the population.

7. **Expected harm vs. good from AI.** Despite perceived risks, people tend to anticipate

more benefts than harms from AI. We estimate that 48% expect more good thani

~~harm,~~ ~~31%~~ ~~more~~ ~~harm~~ ~~than~~ ~~good,~~ ~~19%~~ ~~expecting~~ ~~an~~ ~~even~~ ~~balance,~~ ~~and~~ ~~2%~~ ~~reporting~~

no opinion.

The estimates from this poll may inform policy making and advocacy eforts regarding AIf

risk mitigation. The fndings suggest an attitude of caution from the public, withi

substantially greater support than opposition to measures that are intended to curb the

~~evolution~~ ~~of~~ ~~certain~~ ~~types~~ ~~of~~ ~~AI,~~ ~~as~~ ~~well~~ ~~as~~ ~~for~~ ~~regulation~~ ~~of~~ ~~AI.~~ ~~However,~~ ~~concerns~~ ~~over~~ ~~AI~~

do not yet appear to feature especially prominently in public perception of the existential

risk landscape: people report worrying about it only a little, and rarely picked it as a top

existential threat.

Extrapolating from these fndings, we might expect the US public to be broadly receptive toi

eforts aimed towards mitigating perceived risks of AI, for example through wellf -designed

~~government~~ ~~regulation,~~ ~~or~~ ~~eforts~~ f ~~to~~ ~~prevent~~ ~~risky~~ ~~arms-race~~ ~~type~~ ~~behavior~~ ~~from~~

companies competing to develop AI.

We view these results as preliminary and our questions intentionally broadly replicated

those asked in previous surveys in order to test the robustness of these earlier surveys to

diferent framings. That said, as this topic is complicated and likely novel to mostf

~~respondents,~~ ~~we~~ ~~think~~ ~~there~~ ~~is~~ ~~signifcant~~ i ~~work~~ ~~to~~ ~~be~~ ~~done~~ ~~to~~ ~~further~~ ~~understand~~ ~~people~~ ’ ~~s~~

views and to ensure that our questions are eliciting meaningful attitudes, rather than

    pseudo [opinions. To this end, we have an ongoing project employing qualitative](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/44/2/198/1863851?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

methodology to better understand how people think about these questions.

~~Our~~ ~~framing~~ ~~of~~ ~~this~~ ~~question~~ ~~largely~~ ~~mirrored~~ ~~that~~ ~~of~~ ~~a~~ ~~recent~~ ~~[YouGov](https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/bfoyxp7p28/results_AI%20and%20the%20End%20of%20Humanity.pdf)~~ ~~poll~~ ~~which~~ ~~found~~

[58-61% (depending on framing) would support and 19-23% would oppose a pause on certain](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/)

[kinds of AI development. However, to try to reduce possible demand efects, we only notedf](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/)

that ‘some’ technology leaders signed an open letter (vs. “>1000” referenced in one YouGov

framing), and provided a short piece of information about a countervailing perspective

~~from~~ ‘ ~~other~~ ~~technology~~ ~~leaders~~ ’ ~~.~~ ~~One~~ ~~of~~ ~~the~~ ~~three~~ ~~YouGov~~ ~~framings~~ ~~also~~ ~~included~~ ~~a~~ ~~short~~

statement of opposition, with 60% support and 21% opposition.

Our estimate is that 51% of US adults would be supportive of a pause, whereas 25% would

oppose such a pause. The spread of separate response options for this question and the

exact question framing are shown in Figure 1.

Though our more neutral framing found slightly lower levels of support than YouGov, this

suggests that there is considerably more support than opposition for the AI open letter

among the US population, and that this is robust to moderately diferent framings of thef

issue.

Looking at demographic breakdowns for this outcome, we note that respondents in the

oldest age bracket appeared to be most supportive of such a pause, and also that men are

expected to be less supportive than women. The diference between men and women isf

quite substantial, with about 1.5x more opposition among men than women. Nevertheless,

across all subgroups we looked at we found that support outweighed opposition.

### ~~**Views on regulation of AI**~~

~~As~~ ~~well~~ ~~as~~ ~~views~~ ~~of~~ ~~a~~ ~~specifc~~ i ~~proposal~~ ~~for~~ ~~pausing~~ ~~AI~~ ~~development~~, ~~we~~ ~~asked~~ ~~respondents~~

whether or not they thought AI should be regulated by a federal agency, similarly to how

the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the approval of drugs and medical

[devices. A Harris-MITRE poll of 2050 US adults, in November 2022, estimated that 82% of](https://www.mitre.org/news-insights/news-release/mitre-harris-poll-finds-lack-trust-among-americans-ai-technology)

~~US~~ ~~adults~~ ~~would~~ ~~support~~ ~~government~~ ~~regulation~~ ~~of~~ ~~AI.~~ ~~A~~ ~~more~~ ~~recent~~ ~~[Monmouth](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_021523.pdf/)~~

[University poll from January 2023 estimated 55% favor, and 41% oppose, the idea of having](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_021523.pdf/)

‘a federal agency regulate the use of artifcial intelligence similar to how the FDA regulatesi

the approval of drugs and medical devices’. Using a very similar question framing, we

estimate that a sizable majority of US adults would favor federal regulation of AI (70%), with

21% opposed.

~~Similarly~~ ~~to~~ ~~the~~ ~~question~~ ~~over~~ ~~pausing~~ ~~AI~~ ~~research,~~ ~~we~~ ~~found~~ ~~more~~ ~~females~~ ~~would~~ ~~support~~

such federal regulation. As might be expected, we also estimate that those identifying with

the Democratic party would be more favorable of regulation than those who identify as

Republican or Independent/otherwise afliated. Interestingly, we did not ffi nd shifi s int

support of a pause on AI research by political identity. This may be down to people

~~considering~~ ~~factors~~ ~~such~~ ~~as~~ ~~a~~ ~~self-imposed~~ ~~pause~~ ~~(rather~~ ~~than~~ ~~government~~ ~~involvement),~~ ~~or~~

‘ ’
also concerns over the specifc form of i FDA-like regulatory approaches. In spite of shifst

related to some such demographic features, we again found that support was sizable across

demographic subgroups.

### **Worry about AI**

~~The~~ ~~recent~~ ~~YouGov~~ ~~poll~~ ~~included~~ ~~a~~ ~~question~~ ~~regarding~~ ~~how~~ ~~concerned~~ ~~the~~ ~~respondents~~

were about the possibility that AI might end the human race, fnding 18% very concernedi

~~and~~ ~~28%~~ ~~somewhat~~ ~~concerned.~~ ~~However,~~ ~~this~~ ~~question~~ ~~may~~ ~~have~~ ~~been~~ ~~interpreted~~ ~~by~~

respondents in a number of diferent ways: how probable they thought the outcome was,f

how concerning they thought the outcome would be if it happened, literally how anxious

they were about the possibility of the outcome, or some combination of these.

We wanted to instead get a relatively simple indication of how much people were actively

~~worrying~~ ~~about~~ ~~AI,~~ ~~and~~ ~~a~~ ~~separate~~ ~~indication~~ ~~of~~ ~~their~~ ~~perceived~~ ~~likelihood~~ ~~of~~ ~~extinction~~ ~~risk.~~

We asked respondents to indicate how much, in their daily lives, they worry about the

negative efects of AI on their life and society more broadly. In a separate question, wef

asked about people’s perceived likelihood of extinction caused by AI.

We estimate that the majority of US adults (72%) worry only a little or not at all, with 28%

worrying a fair amount or more and less than 10% worrying ‘a lot’ or more. This might

suggest that even if, when prompted, people express concern over certain aspects of AI and

possible threats it poses to humanity broadly or to their jobs and the economy (as in the

~~Monmouth~~ ~~poll),~~ ~~AI~~ ~~may~~ ~~not~~ ~~feature~~ ~~prominently~~ ~~among~~ ~~their~~ ~~daily~~ ~~worries.~~ ~~We~~ ~~think~~ ~~this~~

can be important to consider, as when one reads that some sizable proportion of the

population is very concerned about AI causing the end of humanity, one may imagine

broad, active emotional engagement with this issue. Our fndings suggest this might not bei

the case.

~~We~~ ~~found~~ ~~relatively~~ ~~little~~ ~~demographic~~ ~~variation~~ ~~in~~ ~~this~~ ~~outcome,~~ ~~although~~ ~~there~~ ~~was~~

slightly greater endorsement for not worrying at all among those with at most high school

education, as well as a slightly increasing share of people worrying a little vs. not at all with

increasing income levels. People in these brackets may correspond to more highly educated

and compensated individuals conducting ‘knowledge work’ and other white collar jobs that

are expected to be most affected by near-term developments in AI.

Of course, even since our survey, there has been additional media coverage of AI risk. Our

fndings present a snapshot as of April 14th, but the landscape of concern may changei

substantially with current events or coverage of this issue.

### **Expectation that AI might lead to human extinction**

~~We~~ ~~additionally~~ ~~asked~~ ~~respondents~~ ~~to~~ ~~indicate~~ ~~how~~ ~~probable~~ ~~they~~ ~~thought~~ ~~it~~ ~~was~~ ~~that~~ ~~AI~~

would cause human extinction. Estimates from the recent YouGov poll suggested some

~~perhaps~~ ~~surprisingly~~ ~~high~~ ~~estimates~~ ~~of~~ ~~the~~ ~~likelihood~~ ~~of~~ ~~extinction~~ ~~caused~~ ~~by~~ ~~AI:~~ ~~17%~~

reported it ‘very likely’ and a further 27% reported it ‘somewhat likely’. One thing to note is

that the question was not time bound, meaning that respondents may have been

considering the possibility of AI representing a serious threat in the very distant future. We

asked respondents two versions of this question: one time bound to within the next 10

~~years,~~ ~~and~~ ~~one~~ ~~time~~ ~~bound~~ ~~to~~ ~~within~~ ~~the~~ ~~next~~ ~~50~~ ~~years~~ ~~and,~~ ~~in~~ ~~a~~ ~~later~~ ~~question,~~ ~~simply~~ ~~about~~

what was likely to cause extinction at all.

530 Divisadero St. PMB #796, San Francisco, California 94117

www.rethinkpriorities.org

17

~~We~~ ~~estimated~~ ~~that~~ ~~the~~ ~~majority~~ ~~of~~ ~~US~~ ~~adults~~ ~~consider~~ ~~it~~ ~~either~~ ~~not~~ ~~at~~ ~~all~~ ~~likely~~ ~~or~~ ~~only~~

slightly likely that AI would lead to human extinction within these timeframes, with the

single most selected option being ‘not at all likely’. However, the anticipated risk of

extinction from AI does increase when moving from the next 10 to the next 50 years. We

estimate that only 9% of the population think extinction from AI to be moderately likely or

more over the next 10 years. This increases to 22% for the next 50 years.

530 Divisadero St. PMB #796, San Francisco, California 94117

www.rethinkpriorities.org

18

The sense that extinction from AI was at all likely decreased with increasing age of

respondents.

We additionally asked respondents to estimate what proportion of the US population they

thought believed it at least moderately likely that AI would lead to human extinction.

Assessing predictions about what other people think is one way in which it can be possible

~~to~~ ~~gauge~~ ~~the~~ ~~extent~~ ~~to~~ ~~which~~ ~~people~~ ~~[may](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2018.09.012)~~ ~~be~~ ~~misrepresenting~~ ~~their~~ ~~own~~ ~~views.~~ ~~The~~ ~~idea~~ ~~is~~

that even people who may not be willing to endorse an attitude for which they could incur

criticism should be willing to honestly report what others' attitudes are. It seems possible

530 Divisadero St. PMB #796, San Francisco, California 94117

19


[that social desirability concerns could lead to underreporting (e.g., if one fears appearing](https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/)

unhinged) _or_ overreporting (e.g., if one fears appearing naive) of worries about AI.

530 Divisadero St. PMB #796, San Francisco, California 94117

www.rethinkpriorities.org

20

We estimate that most people (64%) expected somewhere between 0%-20% of the US

population to grant at least a moderate likelihood of extinction from AI in the next 10

years, with the single-most endorsed option being 0-10% of the population.

In comparison, our results suggested that 9% of the population think it moderately likely or

~~more~~ ~~that~~ ~~AI~~ ~~will~~ ~~cause~~ ~~extinction~~ ~~within~~ ~~the~~ ~~next~~ ~~10~~ ~~years~~ ~~(with~~ ~~an~~ ~~error~~ ~~margin~~ ~~just~~

              crossing over into the 10 20% bracket). Hence, there is an approximate correspondence

between our estimated population level of perceived AI extinction risk based on responses

in this survey, and how much people estimate the population to believe in extinction risks.

We can make estimates at a more granular level by ftting a beta distribution to the binnedi

~~responses,~~ ~~thereby~~ ~~generating~~ ~~estimates~~ ~~of~~ ~~actual~~ ~~percentages.~~ ~~When~~ ~~doing~~ ~~this,~~ ~~we~~

estimate that the average expectation among US adults for how much of the population

believes AI extinction within 10 years to be ‘moderately likely or more’ is 18%, with a

median expectation of 13%. If taken at face value as a ‘wisdom of the crowds’ estimate, with

reduced risk of social desirability bias, then these numbers might indicate that respondents’

~~reported~~ ~~level~~ ~~of~~ ~~belief~~ ~~in~~ ~~AI~~ ~~extinction~~ ~~was~~ ~~slightly~~ ~~suppressed~~ ~~in~~ ~~their~~ ~~direct~~ ~~responses~~ ~~to~~

the possibility of extinction. However, discrepancies between the direct estimates of how

many people anticipate AI extinction, and how much they believe others expect this, could

refect a whole range of factors, not only social desirability. For example, people mayl

simply be overestimating the expectations of others, or there may be more general

~~methodological~~ ~~issues~~ ~~such~~ ~~as~~ ~~the~~ ~~somewhat~~ ~~unfamiliar~~ ~~nature~~ ~~of~~ ~~this~~ ~~type~~ ~~of~~ ~~population~~

prediction question. We are unable to disambiguate these diferent possibilities with thef

present data. Future work could examine these explanations further by looking at the

association between measures of social desirability and frst and third person judgementsi

about AI risk.

### **Most likely causes of human extinction**

~~Considering~~ ~~extinction~~ ~~risk~~ ~~from~~ ~~AI~~ ~~relative~~ ~~to~~ ~~other~~ ~~possible~~ ~~causes~~ ~~may~~ ~~also~~ ~~be~~

informative in terms of understanding public perception of AI risk, as well as other

~~existential~~ ~~threats.~~ ~~In~~ ~~the~~ ~~recent~~ ~~YouGov~~ ~~poll,~~ ~~a~~ ~~range~~ ~~of~~ ~~causes~~ ~~were~~ ~~listed,~~ ~~and~~ ~~respondents~~

had to rate how likely they thought each was to result in human extinction. Nuclear

weapons were the top specifc cause of concern and most likely cause of extinction. AI riski

scored higher than alien invasions and infertility but lower than asteroid impacts. We

simply had respondents pick the single most likely option among several possible causes of

~~human~~ ~~extinction.~~ ~~Consistent~~ ~~with~~ ~~the~~ ~~YouGov~~ ~~fndings,~~ i ~~nuclear~~ ~~war~~ ~~ranked~~ ~~top~~ ~~among~~ ~~the~~

choices, followed by climate change. AI risk was again outranked by Asteroid Impact.

~~The~~ ~~clearest~~ ~~demographic~~ ~~trends~~ ~~were~~ ~~for~~ ~~political~~ ~~diferences,~~ f ~~as~~ ~~well~~ ~~as~~ ~~diferences~~ f

between male and female respondents. Specifcally, Democrats were far more likely thani

Republicans to endorse climate change as a possible cause of extinction, with Republicans

more likely to endorse nuclear war. Independent voters were in between. Some of the

Republicans not endorsing climate change also seemed to shif into AI risk, with ant

~~estimated~~ ~~3%~~ ~~of~~ ~~Democrats~~ ~~vs.~~ ~~6%~~ ~~of~~ ~~Republicans~~ ~~ranking~~ ~~AI~~ ~~risks~~ ~~as~~ ~~the~~ ~~most~~ ~~likely~~ ~~cause~~ ~~of~~

human extinction. Male vs. Female respondents showed a similar pattern of responses as

Republicans vs. Democrats.

### **Greater than human intelligence**

~~As~~ ~~many~~ ~~concerns~~ ~~over~~ ~~AI~~ ~~may~~ ~~depend~~ ~~on~~ ~~the~~ ~~extent~~ ~~to~~ ~~which~~ ~~people~~ ~~anticipate~~ ~~AI~~

becoming competitive with human intelligence, we additionally asked respondents how

likely they think it is that AI will ultimately become more intelligent than people.

We estimate that 67% of US adults think it moderately likely or more that AI will become

more intelligent than people, with more than 40% of people thinking this outcome highly

likely or more.

530 Divisadero St. PMB #796, San Francisco, California 94117

www.rethinkpriorities.org

26

Older adults seemed more skeptical of this possibility than those in younger age brackets

by a substantial margin. Additionally, female respondents were more skeptical than males.

This is of interest given that females nevertheless favor a pause on AI development to a

greater extent than males.

### ~~**Good vs. Harm from AI**~~

~~Finally~~, ~~beyond~~ ~~catastrophic~~ ~~outcomes~~ ~~from~~ ~~AI~~, ~~we~~ ~~were~~ ~~interested~~ ~~in~~ ~~public~~ ~~perceptions~~ ~~of~~

the general good vs. harm that artifcial intelligence might do. Our question was framedi

similarly to the recent Monmouth University poll, which estimated that just 9% of US adults

expect more good than harm from developing artifcial intelligence. An estimated 46%i

~~expected~~ ~~equal~~ ~~goods~~ ~~and~~ ~~harms,~~ ~~and~~ ~~41%~~ ~~expected~~ ~~more~~ ~~harm~~ ~~than~~ ~~good.~~ ~~We~~ ~~expanded~~ ~~on~~

the question’s response options by allowing people to endorse more gradations of good and

harm, which may have inflated estimates of equality.

In contrast to the Monmouth poll, we estimate just 19% of the population are neutral on this

issue, and that 48% lean in the direction of more good than harm, with 31% expecting more

~~harm~~ ~~than~~ ~~good.~~ ~~This~~ ~~is~~ ~~the~~ ~~most~~ ~~substantial~~ ~~deviation~~ ~~from~~ ~~previous~~ ~~polls~~ ~~that~~ ~~we~~ ~~have~~

observed in these AI-related questions. It is not immediately clear what might be the cause

of this discrepancy, although the Monmouth poll was conducted 2 months ago and also

included fewer respondents than our poll (805). The Monmouth poll also described AI as

530 Divisadero St. PMB #796, San Francisco, California 94117

www.rethinkpriorities.org


i

i

28

the creation of ‘computers that can think for themselves’, which may be more conducive to

imagining hostile or frightening agentic AI. If accurate, our fndings indicate the US publici

is not as pessimistic about AI as some other polls might suggest. However, it is also plausible

that this is dependent on exactly how AI is construed by the respondent.

i


~~Male~~ ~~respondents~~ ~~were~~ ~~more~~ ~~likely~~ ~~to~~ ~~have~~ ~~a~~ ~~positive~~ ~~expectation~~ ~~for~~ ~~AI~~ ~~than~~ ~~female~~

respondents, and both Democrats and Republicans had more positive expectations than

i

29

Independently afliated respondents. Female respondents were clearly more negative andfi

also more likely to endorse neutrality. For political afliation, the diffi erence betweenf

groups seemed largely due to Independents being more likely to pick the Neutral option

than for them to have reliably negative expectations.

### ~~**Associations among AI attitudes**~~

~~In~~ ~~addition~~ ~~to~~ ~~estimating~~ ~~public~~ ~~opinion~~, ~~we~~ ~~also~~ ~~assessed~~ ~~some~~ ~~relationships~~ ~~of~~ ~~potential~~

interest between the AI-related outcomes (see the Methodology section for a description of

these models). For support of a pause on certain kinds of AI research, we found that higher

expectations of harm, more worry, and greater expectations of extinction in the next 50

years from AI were positively associated with support for a pause. Those who reported a

~~clear~~ ~~expectation~~ ~~that~~ ~~AI~~ ~~would~~ ~~do~~ ~~more~~ ~~good~~ ~~or~~ ~~much~~ ~~more~~ ~~good~~ ~~than~~ ~~harm~~ ~~were~~

especially likely to oppose a pause.

530 Divisadero St. PMB #796, San Francisco, California 94117

www.rethinkpriorities.org

31

With respect to believing that AI should be regulated in a manner similar to how the FDA

oversees food and drugs, the expectation of AI doing more good than harm was again

associated with heightened disagreement with regulation. Worry and the belief in

~~extinction~~ ~~from~~ ~~AI~~ ~~tended~~ ~~again~~ ~~towards~~ ~~being~~ ~~positively~~ ~~associated~~ ~~with~~ ~~support~~ ~~for~~

regulation, but these associations were not robust.

With respect to worry itself, we found that the anticipation of greater harm than good was

                 strongly associated with worry more so than both the expectation of extinction and the

530 Divisadero St. PMB #796, San Francisco, California 94117

www.rethinkpriorities.org

32

belief that AI would achieve superhuman intelligence. The specifc belief that AI mighti

cause human extinction in the next 50 years was in turn more strongly associated with

### **Conclusions**

The estimates from this poll may inform policy making and advocacy efforts regarding AI

risk mitigation. The findings broadly suggest an attitude of caution from the public, with

substantially higher levels of support than opposition to measures that are intended to curb

the evolution of certain types of AI (a possible pause of some kinds of AI development), as

well as for regulation of AI.

However, concerns over AI do not yet appear to feature especially prominently in public

perception of the existential risk landscape. Notably, extinction caused by AI was selected as

the most substantial existential threat to humanity by only a small minority of people. In

addition, it does not seem that risks from AI are something that most people are worrying

about a lot in their daily lives (though note that we do not have a comparison for how much

people report worrying about other issues). We are conducting additional qualitative

research to better understand people’s worries about, and their perceptions of risk from AI,

which may further inform our understanding of AI risk perception.

US adults appear to appreciate that AI may well become more intelligent than people, and

place non-negligible risk on the possibility that AI could cause extinction within the next 50

years. Nevertheless, people generally expect there to be more good than harm to come

from AI.

Extrapolating from these findings, we might expect the US public to be broadly receptive to

efforts aimed towards mitigating what are perceived as plausible and potentially highly

concerning risks of AI, for example through well-designed government regulation, or

efforts to prevent risky arms-race type behavior from companies competing to develop AI.

However, there may be little mass appeal for what might be considered more extreme

stances relative to where public perception and concern currently rests. This may be

particularly the case given that people anticipate substantial good to come from AI, not just

bad. Of course, this does not mean that such communication could not _shift_ public opinion

- we are describing where the US population appears to be at, and not suggesting where

public opinion optimally should be, with respect to AI risk perceptions.

As AI risk represents a relatively new area of public discourse, we anticipate that current

events and media discussion could still substantially shift public perception.
### **Appendix** **Methodology**

On April 14th 2023, Rethink Priorities conducted an online poll regarding public

perceptions of AI risk, as well as attitudes towards regulation of AI development and

[support/opposition of the recently proposed pause on training/development of certain](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/)

types of AI models.

The poll sampled 2523 US respondents aged 18 or above on the online sampling pool

_Prolific,_ of whom 2444 consented, answered questions, and passed requisite attention checks

for the analyses presented below. We then used Multilevel Regression and Poststratification

(MRP) to generate population-level estimates for US adult public opinion, accounting for

Age, Sex, Race, Household Income, Education, Political party affiliation, as well as the US

State/District and 2020 Republican vote share for the state.

MRP is a technique that can be used to estimate outcomes in a specific target population

based upon a potentially unrepresentative sample population. In brief, the technique

involves generating estimates of how a range of features (e.g., education, income, age) are

associated with the outcome of interest from the sampled population, using multilevel

regression. Based on the known distribution of combinations of these features in the target

population, the poststratification step then involves making predictions from the multilevel

regression model for the target population. This approach is widely used to make accurate

predictions of population level opinion and voting based upon unrepresentative samples

(e.g., Wang, W., Rothschild, D., Goel, S., & Gelman, A. (2015). Forecasting elections with

non-representative polls. _International Journal of Forecasting_, _31_ (3), 980-991.), and also allows

inferences to be made about specific subgroups within the population of interest.

### **Associations among AI measures**

To assess possible associations among the different AI-related measures, we conducted

Bayesian multiple regression with the respective AI-related predictor variables entered as

ordinal predictors (i.e., monotonic effects). For each of these models, we additionally

included Age, Race, Sex, Region, Education, Income, and Political Party Affiliation as

control variables. When making predictions from the model, we varied the value of the

ordinal predictor of interest while holding each of the other AI variables constant at their

median in the sample data, and then averaged the predictions across all the demographic

variables.

Simple pairwise associations (Spearman’s rank) between all the AI-related variables

presented above can be seen in the correlation matrix here:

### **Sensitivity to poststratification/weighting approach**

Given that our sample was generated from online respondents, there are some concerns

that despite efforts to make the sample representative of the population, we cannot

[represent certain kinds of people who are simply not online. In data from 2021 from Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Internet-Frequency-Update-Methodology-Topline.pdf)

[Research, it was estimated that around 7% of US adults would report never using the](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Internet-Frequency-Update-Methodology-Topline.pdf)

internet. To try to correct for the possibility that an overly online sample might affect our

results, we did include an assessment of internet frequency, and were then able to weight

the sample according to answers to that question. Including this outcome variable is not

possible in the MRP approach, but can be included in weights. As shown in the plots below,

there is little if any difference between our MRP estimates and those generated by using an

alternative weighting protocol that includes internet use frequency.

We additionally conducted some multiple regression analyses in which we included Age,

Gender, Race, Education, Income, US Region, Political Party ID, and Internet Use

Frequency as predictors of each of these main outcome variables. Averages over the other

demographic variables and then assessing the specific differences among internet

frequency answers, we see that for some variables, there appears to be a slight (or

sometimes more substantial) effect of internet frequency on responses. However, the key

consideration is that such respondents make up only a minority of the US population, and

so even when such respondents’ answers are weighted for inclusion, their responses would

have to be very highly and consistently different in order to shift the overall population

estimate.

46

Finally, where there do appear to be differences between those with higher and lower levels

of internet use, infrequent internet users tend to be _more_ rather than _less_ concerned about

AI. Hence, we do not think that our responses risk over-emphasising the concern people

have over AI. However, we of course do not have information on people who actually never

use the internet, and so if these people’s responses would be really dramatically different

from the lower frequency users we do have data on, then this could be a threat to the

validity of the conclusions. Again, however, as these people represent just 7% of the

population as of 2021, their responses would have to be different in the extreme to shift

population estimates.

This section contains information regarding details of the survey design, implementation,

and analysis, as proposed by the American Association of Public Opinion Research

(AAPOR).

1. **Data Collection Strategy:** This research is based on answers to a cross-sectional

online survey.

2. **Who Sponsored the Research and Who Conducted It** . This research was funded

and conducted by _Rethink Priorities_ (RP), a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization

and think tank, registered in California, US. RP financial disclosures can be found

3. **Measurement Tools/Instruments.** The survey questions and response options are

presented in the graphs depicting population-level estimates in the main document

above.

4. **Population Under Study.** This research aimed to assess US Adult public opinion.

5. **Method Used to Generate and Recruit the Sample.** This research used a

non-probability sampling approach, involving respondents opting-in to take part in

the study via the _Prolific_ participant pool platform. Respondents are not informed

about the specific content of the survey until entering the survey, seeing only a

description of _‘A survey about current attitudes’_, thereby reducing bias from

respondents who enter being specifically interested in artificial intelligence.

Respondents were required to be registered on Prolific as adults (aged 18 and above),

resident in the US. No quotas were used for sampling purposes. Respondents were

informed that the survey was expected to take approximately 5 minutes, and they

would be compensated £0.75 (~$0.93) for their completion of the survey.

6. **Method(s) and Mode(s) of Data Collection.** Respondents were recruited via the

online platform _Prolific,_ and completed the survey using the _Qualtrics_ survey

software platform. The survey was offered in English.

7. **Dates of Data Collection.** Data collection for this survey took place on April 14th,

2023.

8. **Sample Sizes and Precision of the Results.** The survey received 2523 respondents,

of whom 2444 completed it, met inclusion criteria, and passed attention checks. The

primary results are based upon these 2444 respondents. Margins of error in primary

analyses represent the means and 95% highest density intervals (HDIs) of posterior

distributions derived from Bayesian Multilevel Regression and Poststratification

(MRP). Please see the plots and main text of the report for the uncertainty associated

with each result, as there is no single +/- margin of error that applies to all estimates.

The central estimates are presented as rounded percentages, while the margin of

error is presented to 1 decimal place (this ensures that the width of the margin of

error is not understated, as rounding the upper and lower bound of the error

margin could artificially reduce its width). MRP is a technique that can be used to

estimate outcomes in a specific target population based upon a potentially

unrepresentative sample population. The technique involves generating estimates of

how a range of features (e.g., education, income, age) are associated with the

outcome of interest from the sampled population, using multilevel regression.

Based on the known distribution of combinations of these features in the target

population, the poststratification step then involves making predictions from the

multilevel regression model for the target population. This approach is widely used

to make accurate predictions of population level opinion and voting based upon

unrepresentative samples, and also allows inferences to be made about specific

subgroups within the population of interest (e.g., Wang, W., Rothschild, D., Goel, S.,

& Gelman, A. (2015). Forecasting elections with non-representative polls.

Bafumi, J. (2004). Bayesian multilevel estimation with poststratification: State-level

estimates from national polls. _Political Analysis_, _12_ (4), 375-385.). Model specification

for multilevel regression used respondent State/District, Region, Age bracket,

Completed education, Household income bracket, Sex, Racial identification, Sex *

Racial identification, Completed education * Age bracket, Political party

identification, and the State/Disctrict’s Republican vote share for the 2020

Presidential election. The following section describes the poststratification.

9. **How the Data Were Weighted** . Regression model predictions were poststratified

according to the cross-tabulated proportions of the US population with the

respective demographic features outlined in the previous section based upon public

release of the _Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey_ for US adults. This

poststratification table was extended to include a posterior distribution of expected

political party identification based upon multilevel regression using data from

_Harvard University’s 2020 Cooperative Election Study_ .

10. **How the Data Were Processed and Procedures to Ensure Data Quality.** In addition

to _Prolific’s_ in-house checks for participant quality and integrity, we included 2

attention checks - one at the beginning of the survey, and one towards the end 
interspersed among typical demographic questions - to ensure participants were

reading the questions and answering correctly. Respondents were required to pass

both these checks in order to be included in analyses.

11. **Limitations of the Design and Data Collection** . Survey data and its analysis and

interpretation can be prone to numerous issues. One particular concern for

530 Divisadero St. PMB #796, San Francisco, California 94117

54

non-probability samples (i.e., opt-in, online surveys) is the potential for biases in

recruitment that are not or cannot be counteracted by weighting or poststratification

approaches. In the appendix of our report, we detail an alternative weighting

procedure geared towards incorporating possible biases from a largely online-savvy

sample, which showed analogous results to our main analyses. However, it is not

possible to correct for all possible sampling biases.
