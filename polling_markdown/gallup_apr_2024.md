﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

We are living in a time of unprecedented change
in which emerging technologies, including artificial
intelligence, promise to reshape personal and
professional lives around the globe. Here in the U.S.,

we’re in the midst of a presidential campaign and
political climate where it seems increasingly difficult to
find common ground.

Businesses are caught in the middle of it all. They are

trying to navigate these disruptive cultural, social and

political trends while responding to the opinions and

expectations of the American public. These are the

very consumers who buy their products and services,

the employees who keep their companies going and
the influencers who increasingly shape how we are all
perceived and judged.

In turbulent times like these,

how should business leaders

determine a strategy to move
forward? I believe the first and
most important steps are to ask

questions, listen and learn.

Over the last three years, the Bentley University-Gallup

Business in Society Report has been doing just that,

measuring the opinions of Americans about where

businesses are succeeding in bringing about positive

change – and where they are falling short. The data in

our survey represent more than a snapshot. Through

this year-over-year vantage point, a clearer picture

is emerging, showing which beliefs and perceptions

remain consistent and which are rising or falling

over time.

**3**


This year’s survey of 5,835 U.S. adults unearthed

some interesting insights into Americans’ views.

Notably, 63% of Americans say that business has

a positive impact on people’s lives, up from 55% in

2022. Despite this positive view, an overwhelming

majority (77%) say they don’t trust businesses to use
artificial intelligence responsibly. More than half of
Americans (57%) say if businesses were transparent

about their use of AI, it would reduce those concerns.

And while most people would like businesses to take

a leading role and speak out on policy areas such as
climate change (54%), diversity, equity and inclusion

(53%), and mental health (53%), in other areas the

message from Americans to companies is clear:

“Stick to business.”

At their best, businesses are problem-solvers,

identifying solutions to obstacles in society and making

those solutions available to large numbers of people.

When functioning well, businesses can improve the

lives of their customers, employees, communities

and shareholders.

I know that these are challenging times. But I’m also a

big believer in the power of business and its potential

as a powerful force for good. I hope that insights from

this survey will help businesses better understand
Americans’ views so they can most effectively deliver
on that vast potential.

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

Since 2022, Bentley University and Gallup have partnered to quantify
Americans’ attitudes toward businesses, generally, and the impact they
have on their personal lives and society at large.

The 2024 _Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Report_ builds upon insights released in 2022 and
2023, identifying changes in attitudes toward businesses since the first study. It also addresses new,
important issues businesses are contending with, including the impact of political endorsements.

The 2024 results are based on a Gallup poll of 5,835 U.S. adults, aged 18 or older, conducted

from April 29‑May 6, 2024.


Most Americans believe businesses are good for

society but see them underperforming in the areas

they think businesses should prioritize.

- In 2024, 63% of Americans see businesses as

having a somewhat positive (41%) or extremely

positive (22%) impact on people’s lives. This

63% is unchanged from 2023, but is an

eight‑percentage‑point improvement over 2022,

when 55% of Americans reported the same.

- Americans attach the highest importance to

businesses making money in ethical ways (79%)
and providing high-quality healthcare benefits to
employees (71%). Smaller majorities believe it is

extremely important for businesses to prioritize
employee-oriented practices, such as offering
mental health benefits (56%), avoiding major pay
gaps between CEOs and workers (56%) and
offering flexible work arrangements (52%).

- Less than half of Americans think businesses are

doing an excellent or good job in any of the areas

to which Americans attach the highest importance.


Americans believe businesses play a role

in politics, but public stances on issues

and candidate endorsements could carry

business risks.

- Americans’ support for businesses taking a

public stance on current events continues to

wane in 2024: 38% of Americans say businesses

should take a public stance on current events,

down from 41% in 2023 and 48% in 2022.

- Out of the 13 topics tested, at least half of

Americans are interested in businesses taking
a stance on just three: climate change (54%),

mental health (53%) and diversity, equity and

inclusion (53%).

- Three-quarters of Americans believe businesses

have some (44%) or a lot (32%) of influence on
presidential elections, but just 17% want them

to take a stance on political candidates.

- Political endorsements can drive away more

customers than they attract. More than six

in 10 Democrats and Republicans (68% and

61%, respectively) say they would be less likely

to purchase from a company that endorsed a

candidate from the opposing party.

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

Americans remain cynical about the use of
artificial intelligence (AI) in business. Even those
most knowledgeable about AI are concerned
about its effects.

- The percentage of adults who believe AI is more

harmful than helpful has decreased in the past year

from 40% to 31%. Most of this shift was driven

by Americans over the age of 30, while views are

relatively unchanged among 18‑ to 29-year-olds.

- For two straight years, three-quarters of

Americans have said they believe AI will reduce

the total number of jobs in the country over the

next 10 years. Moreover, 77% of adults do not

trust businesses to use AI responsibly.

- However, 57% of Americans say businesses

could reduce their concerns about AI by being

transparent about how they are using it.

- Americans who claim the greatest knowledge about

AI are still more likely to believe AI does more harm

than good than to say it does more good than harm

(31% vs. 22%).

**7**


U.S. employees would benefit from greater
flexibility in their current work arrangements.

- Three in four U.S. workers — unchanged from

2023 — say working a four-day, 40-hour workweek

would positively impact their wellbeing. Meanwhile,

41% of workers say being required to return to
the office five days a week would have a negative
impact on them.

- Americans almost universally say high-quality health

benefits (95%) and workplace culture (94%) are
somewhat or extremely important factors when

deciding which company to apply for.

Almost as many (89%) say the company offering

flexible work arrangements is somewhat or
extremely important.

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

Americans continue to view businesses as better

for people than they are for the environment.

In 2024, 63% of Americans see businesses as

having a somewhat positive (41%) or extremely

positive (22%) impact on people’s lives. This 63% is

unchanged from 2023 but is an eight-percentage-point

improvement over 2022, when 55% of Americans

reported the same.

Americans also continue to think businesses are good

at making people’s lives better. A similar 62% believe
businesses are effective at making a positive impact on
people’s lives, although only 8% believe businesses are
“extremely effective” at doing so.

FIGURE 1


Americans are more skeptical about the impact

businesses have on the environment. Nearly half

(48%) say businesses have a somewhat or extremely

negative impact on the environment. Just shy

of one in four (24%) U.S. adults say businesses

have a somewhat or extremely positive impact on

the environment.

Views about the environmental impact businesses
have differ by age and political affiliation. Americans
under age 30 are about half as likely as those aged 60

and older to say businesses have a positive impact on

the environment (16% vs. 29%). The gap is even wider

between Democrats (15%) and Republicans (38%).

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

Americans believe businesses should prioritize
ethical profit-making and employee wellbeing.

More than seven in 10 adults consider it extremely

important that businesses make money in ethical ways
(79%) and provide high-quality healthcare benefits
to employees (71%).


But Americans also see priorities for businesses with

implications outside the workplace, including operating

in a sustainable way for the environment (61%) and

improving the communities they serve (59%).

Notably, the lowest priority for Americans is promoting
diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Slightly less than
half (49%) believe fostering DEI is extremely important

for businesses to do, which is consistent with results

in 2023, but a decline from the 53% who said

so in 2022.


Smaller majorities believe it is extremely important for

businesses to prioritize other pro-employee practices,
such as offering mental health benefits (56%), avoiding
major pay gaps between CEOs and workers (56%)
and offering flexible work arrangements (52%).


and offering flexible work arrangements (52%). Young adults, Black Americans, women and

Democrats are more likely than their peers to believe

it is extremely important for businesses to do all

these things. These groups are particularly eager

for businesses to promote DEI, provide high-quality
healthcare and offer flexible work arrangements.

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

Support for businesses taking a public stance is

waning, but half of Americans are still interested

in hearing from companies on climate change,

mental health and DEI.

While 95% of adults believe business has an important

role to play in improving the communities in which they

operate, most Americans prefer that businesses do

so quietly.

Americans’ support for businesses taking a public

stance on current events continues to wane in

2024: 38% currently say businesses should do this,

down from 41% in 2023 and 48% in 2022.

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

Between 2023 and 2024, the percentage of Americans

who say businesses should take a stance declined
statistically on five of the 12 topics tested in both
years’ surveys. While desire for businesses to speak

out on these issues was low to begin with, even fewer

Americans in 2024 favor businesses taking a stance
on major sociopolitical issues such as religion (13%),

political candidates (17%) and abortion (20%).

FIGURE 6


By and large, most Americans do not want to hear

from businesses on the 13 topics in this year’s survey.

The three exceptions are climate change (54%), mental

health (53%) and diversity, equity and inclusion (53%),

albeit by narrow margins.

On each of these three topics, younger Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 are more likely than older

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

Nearly half of Americans believe promoting diversity is extremely important, but don’t see businesses

as delivering.

Most adults believe diversity can boost business performance. Roughly six in 10 believe diverse businesses are
more profitable (59%) and innovative (63%). Just under one-third believe diversity leads to greater conflict (32%) or
discrimination within the workforce (32%).

FIGURE 8

**Americans See Value in Diversity in the Workforce**

Based on what you know, or have experienced, please indicate the extent to which you _feel_ the following statements

are true.

% Completely true % Somewhat true % Somewhat untrue % Completely untrue

Due to rounding, percentages may sum to 100%, +/-1.


While nearly half of adults believe it is extremely

important for businesses to promote diversity (49%)

and a slim majority (53%) want them to take public

stances on it, fewer see businesses as doing a good
or excellent job promoting diversity (44%).


For a small fraction of Americans, a company’s

workforce diversity factors into their purchasing

decisions. Ten percent of U.S. adults indicate they

recently researched the demographics of a company’s

employees prior to purchasing their products or

services. That is far less than the 29% of Americans

who report researching a company’s sustainability

or environmental impact prior to purchasing their

products or services.

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

Most Americans believe businesses have at least some influence over the presidential candidates that
people vote for.

Three-quarters of Americans believe businesses have some (44%) or a lot (32%) of influence on presidential
elections. Yet adults do not necessarily want to see businesses putting their thumbs on the scales of major policy

debates — just 17% want them to take a stance on political candidates.

FIGURE 9


**Business Influence on Vote Choice**

How much influence do you think businesses have on
which presidential candidate Americans vote for?

% None at all % Not much % Some % A lot

FIGURE 10


White Americans are almost three times less

likely than Black Americans to say businesses

should take a stance on political candidates

(12% vs. 32%, respectively). The gap is similarly

wide between Republicans and Democrats

(9% vs. 23%, respectively).

However, there are no partisan or racial differences
in Americans’ belief that businesses influence
presidential elections: Black Americans (77%) are

as likely as White Americans (76%) to say that
businesses have at least some influence, and
Democrats (78%) and Republicans (76%) are

equally likely to say this.

Companies’ political endorsements are much more likely to hurt sales than increase them.

Political endorsements can drive away more customers than they attract. More than six in 10 Democrats and

Republicans (68% and 61%, respectively) say they would be less likely to purchase from a company that endorsed

a candidate from the opposing party. If companies endorse a candidate from a person’s preferred political party, it is

unlikely to hurt the business within that group.

BentleyU_FrcGood_082224_hs

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

About one in four Americans (26%) say they research
a company’s political endorsements or affiliations
prior to purchasing a product or service. For the most

part, these consumers are researching companies
to find and actively support those that align with their
values, rather than researching which companies to

avoid. This is true of respondents from both parties

who say they have done this research, though

Democrats (35%) are more likely to look at the political
affiliations of businesses than Republicans (20%) or
independents (21%).

**19**


These distinctions are important because Americans

are likely thinking a lot about where they are spending
their money ahead of the coming U.S. election: 80%
of adults say the affordability of products and services
has declined in the past year. Moreover, about half say

the quality and availability of those more expensive

products and services have declined in the past year.

### Business and Artificial Intelligence
###### Americans remain cynical about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in business. Even those most knowledgeable about AI are concerned about its effects.

**20**
Copyright © 2024 Gallup, Inc. All rights reserved.

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

Fewer Americans consider AI detrimental than in

previous years, although more still see its harm

outweighing its good.

The percentage of those who believe AI is more

harmful than helpful has decreased in the past year

from 40% to 31%. Most of this shift has been driven by

Americans over the age of 30, with declines of at least

seven points in each older age group.

FIGURE 12

**In your opinion, does artificial intelligence…**

% 2023 % 2024

While 64% of Americans report being at least

somewhat knowledgeable of AI, just 9% say they

are extremely knowledgeable. Majorities in every age

group of Americans say they are at least somewhat
knowledgeable about AI, but knowledge drops off
sharply among those aged 60 and older. Men are more

likely than women to profess being at least somewhat
knowledgeable (72% vs. 57%, respectively).

**21**


The largest drop was among those aged 45 to 59,

from 47% in 2023 to 34% in 2024. Attitudes remain

mostly unchanged among 18- to 29-year-olds (30% in

2023 vs. 27% in 2024).

The majority of Americans believe AI has a net neutral
effect — doing equal amounts of harm and good. But
they are more than twice as likely to believe it does

more harm than good than they are to believe the
good of AI offsets its harm (31% vs. 13%).

Generally, those more knowledgeable about AI are less
likely to express concern about its effects. However,
even those who say they are extremely knowledgeable

about AI are more likely to believe it does more harm

than good than to say it does more good than harm

(31% vs. 22%).

BentleyU_FrcGood_082224_hs

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

Most believe AI will cost the U.S. jobs and do not trust businesses to use it responsibly.

Three-quarters of Americans say AI will reduce the total number of jobs in the country over the next 10 years, the

same percentage that said so last year. Also similar to last year, 77% of adults do not trust businesses much (44%) or
at all (33%) to use AI responsibly. Additionally, nearly seven in 10 of those who are extremely knowledgeable about AI

have little to no trust in businesses to use AI responsibly.

FIGURE 13

**Americans’ Views About AI’s Impact on Jobs and Trust in Businesses**

% 2023 % 2024

These are especially top-of-mind considerations for those who believe AI does more harm than good (AI skeptics).
Those skeptics are 29 percentage points more likely than AI promoters (who see more good than harm) to believe

AI will reduce jobs in the U.S. (88% vs. 59%, respectively). Also, AI skeptics are more than three times as likely as

promoters to say they do not trust businesses at all to use AI responsibly (55% vs. 16%, respectively).

Transparency could ease Americans’ worries about how AI is being used.

Most Americans are concerned about all six of the AI use case examples that were offered in the survey. The topic
that garners the least concern — using AI to help students with homework or studying — is still at least somewhat
concerning to two-thirds of adults. At least eight in 10 adults are concerned about using AI for hiring decisions (85%),
driving vehicles (83%) and recommending medical advice (80%).

How concerned are you about artificial intelligence being used in the following areas?

But there are steps that businesses can take to alleviate these concerns. When asked to choose from a list of actions

that businesses can take to most reduce concerns about AI, Americans most frequently say companies should be

transparent about how AI is being used in business practices (57%).

is important when they are seeking a job — such

as operating sustainably, improving the community

and the lives of others and promoting diversity. But
individual benefits such as healthcare and flexibility
continue to reign supreme.

High-quality healthcare benefits and workplace culture
remain top priorities for Americans when searching for
a job, but flexible work arrangements (when possible)

is not far behind.

FIGURE 16


Americans almost universally say high-quality
healthcare benefits (95%) and workplace culture
(94%) are somewhat or extremely important factors

when deciding which company to apply for. Almost
as many (89%) say the company offering flexible work
arrangements is somewhat or extremely important.

Compared with these individual benefits, Americans
continue to place less focus on societal benefits like
promoting DEI, operating sustainably and making the

world a better place. The importance of promoting

DEI has slipped every year since 2022, with two-thirds

(66%) saying it is somewhat or extremely important to

the job search in 2024, down from 73% in 2022 and

68% in 2023.

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

U.S. employees would benefit from greater
flexibility in their current work arrangements.

Other Gallup data show that on-site workers with

four-day workweeks have higher rates of wellbeing,

but no higher rates of engagement at work than their
colleagues who work five- or six-day workweeks.
Burnout is slightly higher among those working four
days per week than those working five days. The best
solution likely varies by organization, role, job demands

and customer needs. [2]

In the 2024 Bentley-Gallup survey, three in four U.S.

workers — unchanged from 2023 — say working a

four-day, 40-hour workweek would positively impact

their wellbeing. Meanwhile, 42% of workers say being
required to return to the office five days a week would
have a negative impact.

FIGURE 17

**Employees of All Ages Prefer Four Days Over Five**


Workers in all major demographic categories embrace

the idea that a four-day, 40-hour workweek would

be good for their wellbeing, but there are deep
generational divides on the effect that a mandatory,
five-day return to office order would have. Nearly half
of workers younger than age 45 say it would negatively
affect their wellbeing, but this expectation drops
sharply among the 45 to 59 group (38%) and 60 and
older group (26%).
###### Three in four workers say working a four-day, 40-hour workweek would positively impact their wellbeing.


If your employer did the following, what type of effect would it have on your wellbeing:

Offered a four-day 40-hour workweek option for employees who typically work 40 hours in a 5-day workweek

### Methodology

Copyright © 2024 Gallup, Inc. All rights reserved.

﻿Bentley-Gallup Business in Society Survey | 2024 Report

The 2024 Bentley-Gallup Business in Society study

is based on a Gallup Panel web survey completed

by 5,835 adults in the U.S., aged 18 and older,

conducted April 29-May 6, 2024. The Gallup Panel

is a probability-based longitudinal panel of U.S.
adults whom Gallup selects using random-digit-dial

phone interviews that cover landlines and cellphones.

Gallup also uses address-based sampling methods

to recruit Panel members. The Gallup Panel is not an

opt-in panel.

The sample for this study was weighted to be
demographically representative of the U.S. adult
population, using the most recent Current Population
Survey figures.

For results based on this sample, the margin of
sampling error at the 95% confidence level is
±2.1 percentage points for response percentages

around 50% and is ±1.3 percentage points for

response percentages around 10% or 90%,
design effect included. Margins of error are larger
for subsamples.

**29**


2023 and 2022 results are from previous iterations of

the Bentley-Gallup Business in Society study. In 2023,

the survey was conducted between May 8-15, 2023.

For these results, the maximum margin of sampling
error is ±1.8 percentage points at the 95% confidence
level. In 2022, the survey was conducted between

June 8-19, 2022. For these results, the maximum

margin of sampling error is ±1.9 percentage points at
the 95% confidence level.

In addition to sampling error, question wording
and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can
introduce error or bias into the findings of public
opinion polls.
